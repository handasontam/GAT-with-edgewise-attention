       " 'Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the\\n_Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television\\nstation, KTVB Channel 7.\\n\\nRandy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 5.\\n\\nMonday, April 19, 1993 was the fifth day of the trial.\\n\\nSynopsis: Government informant Kenneth Fadeley testified that\\nRandy Weaver sold him two shotguns in violation of the National\\nFirearms Act of 1934.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge\\nasks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because\\nof possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.\\n\\nThe testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently\\nended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither\\nby KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.\\n\\nThe day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley,\\nwho had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person\\nnamed Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as\\nan informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms\\nin his dealings with Randy Weaver.\\n\\nFadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an\\nAryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The two\\nthen met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in\\ntime) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weapons\\ntransaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, \"He felt like he\\n(Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the\\nWhite cause.\"\\n\\nThe two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and\\nlater went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second\\nmeeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to\\ntape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12-\\ngauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of\\n19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge\\nshotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of\\n24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel\\nlength and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver\\nis reported to have said that he could perform better work once\\nhis machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility\\nof future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars\\nfor the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty\\ndollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have\\nsimply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 -\\nover a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).\\n\\nThe next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that\\nhis \"source\" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead\\nof the one-hundred fifty he\\'d promised.  At this point, Weaver\\nsuspected he was dealing with an informant, \"I had a guy in\\nSpokane tell me you were bad.\"  Fadeley managed to convince\\nWeaver otherwise.\\n\\nThe _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were\\nmade of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these\\nmeetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also\\nreported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki\\nWeaver (Randy Weaver\\'s wife) was played to the court.  There must\\nhave also been phone taps.\\n\\nThese tapes were played to the court via both headphones and\\nloudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver\\'s\\nattorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to\\nmake sure that the government proved its case, \"...if it has a\\ncase at all...\" according to the rules.\\n\\nRandy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his\\nwife\\'s voice on the tape.\\n\\nU.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear\\naccounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the\\nWeaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect\\nthis trial is not explained.\\n\\nOther notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning\\nKevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are\\nsurprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were\\nsurprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained\\nin the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy\\nWeaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that\\nHarris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report\\nthat the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming\\nat Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics\\nare charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the\\nonly non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and\\nDeputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that\\nHarris\\'s survival is simply due to divine intervention.\\n\\nTuesday, April 20, 1993 will be the sixth day of the trial. \\nKenneth Fadeley\\'s testimony is scheduled to continue. \\n\\n',\n",

Their faults were in intelligence\\n(military and civilian definitions apply), tactics (attacking during DAYLIGHT??), methodology (the FBI stated that it is against government policy to assault\\na position where there are non-combatants/potential hostages without attempting\\nnegotiations first), and legality.  The BATF's jurisdiction is TAXES on firearms\\nand tobacco.  They are a branch of the department of the treasury.  They have\\nvery curiously backed away from their claims of illegal weaponry to push the\\nchild-abuse charges... The BATF has no jurisdiction over non-firearms/tobacco\\nissues! And the charges of child-abuse had been investigated in the past with\\nno violence and no validation.  This was a clear case of first the BATF, then\\nthe FBI, having watched too many Rambo movies...  My opinion is that the agent\\nin charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid, criminal negligence,\\nmurder, civil rights violations, and breaking his/her oath to uphold and defend\\nthe Constitution of the US.  The warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the \\npublic what justification the BATF thought it had in committing an armed assault\\non American citizens.

       " '\\n    I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment\\nof WFAN and WIP(I go to school in Philadelphia, and I listen to\\nboth stations on a consistant basis.)  Now that the fan has Mike\\nLupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the \\nbig name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance\\nHe did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he \\nhad Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.  \\n  Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent:\\nMorning show:\\n  In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi, \\nand Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti\\nhad a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries\\nto copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of\\nsports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he\\ninterjects humor and politics into his show.\\n10 AM to 12 Noon:\\n  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their\\nabilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the\\nadvantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller\\nwho is asking about who the local team is going to draft\\nin the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get\\nbetter interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that\\nthey were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless\\nit was a major story.\\n  I would consider this even because they are two different\\nstyles of host.\\n\\n12 Noon to 2 PM:\\n  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to \\nJody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been\\non for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability\\nto transcend the \"homer\" mentality of the Philadelphia fan\\nbase.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia \\nspelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.\\nWhere else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0\\nscore without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning \\'guys\\')\\nI do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight\\nand I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating\\nhosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on \\neither station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and\\nyou can\\'t get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.\\n\\n2PM to 4PM:\\n  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and \\nRusso(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided\\nin my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,\\nbut they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10\\nto 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do\\nget great guests and that is the basis for their show, so\\nit is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the\\nappearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which\\nare often hilarious.  \\n\\n4 PM to 7 PM:\\n  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like\\nMike Missanelli but I just can\\'t stomach Steve Fredericks.  \\nI know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he\\nwas at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly\\nhomer now.  I don\\'t listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there\\nis a game on that night, but you will see later for the \\nreason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.\\n\\n7 PM to Midnight:\\n  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes\\nEli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on\\ncharges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my\\nnerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go\\nnuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show)\\nOn FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets\\nJets, or St. John\\'s basketball.  If the game is on the\\nwest coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course\\nI think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but\\nWIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season.\\n(If this is the sports station, why did they lose the\\nIGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.))\\nDuring the summer, it\\nis all talk on WIP.\\n\\n\\nOverall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with\\nthe exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and\\n12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.   \\n\\n\\n\\n            Rich\\n-- \\n  \"You\\'ve read the hat, now see the movie.\"\\n                   -Imus in the morning \\n  \"A blurb?

       " \"\\nI am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling\\nor perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my points.\\nHowever, I think you approached this the wrong way. I believe all of the\\npeople mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I\\nfeel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to\\ngo but that they would deserve it more. \\n\\nIMHO \\nDave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he\\ncould hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not\\nthink he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the\\ngame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I\\nstill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.\\n\\nDave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several\\nseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are\\n(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a\\nbit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other\\npeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial\\ncontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are\\nsome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he\\nwas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to\\nand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I\\nthink it deserves some consideration.\\n\\nLee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would\\ndeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.\\n\\nDarrell Evans - No.\\n\\nEddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although\\na silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not\\nsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both\\nthe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just\\nthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.\\n\\nJeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the\\ntop of my head I would take Lee Smith first.\\n\\n\\nWell, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I\\ntalked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been\\ninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very\\ngood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers\\noffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for\\nevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have\\nshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved\\ngames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a\\ngame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more\\nthan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).\\nBoth of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does\\nGeorge Brett who also belongs in this class of player.\\n\\n\\nSteve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone\\nmaking a case for him. \\n\\nJack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might\\nbring up his name.\\n\\nKirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still\\nhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my\\nprobably will turn into a definately.\\n\\nNolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him\\nhaving some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not\\nhear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the\\ncontributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would\\nnot say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even\\ntop 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame\\nbecause of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -\\neven with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL\\nthe possible votes.\\n\\nSo in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do\\nbut I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least\\nnot without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.\\n\\nYes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan\\nMaybe - Murray and L. Smith\\nNo - Reardon, Garvey, Morris, Evans and definately Kingman\\n\\nAs I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this\\nup - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.\\n\\nMike\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nI am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a Postscript Type 1 or\\nTrueType font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted\\nby a 3D scanline renderer. \\n\\nI have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but\\nhave never had the need to implement such a system. Well, I now have the\\nopportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have\\nsome of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.\\n\\nThe main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to\\nturn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle\\ncomplex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple\\npolygons). For example, in the letter \"O\" there are two outlines:\\n\\n\\t1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)\\n\\t2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.\\n\\nOne common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply \\nconnect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the\\ntwo outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a \"polygon with\\nholes\". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior\\npolygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.\\n\\nI do not want to use this simplistic system since:\\n\\n\\t1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple\\n\\t\\tmatter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for\\n\\t\\tsome fancy fonts).\\n\\t2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.\\n\\nFrom my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid\\ndecomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as\\nis done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal\\npolygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.\\n\\nMy question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into\\npolgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution\\nsince it creates excess number of polygons.\\n\\nAnother question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create\\nbevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on these\\nsubjects but I can\\'t tell which method is the best to implement.\\n\\nThanks for any pointers.\\n\\n--> Rob Lansdale\\n\\n-- \\nRobert Lansdale - (416) 978-6619       Dynamic Graphics Project\\t\\nInternet: lansd@dgp.toronto.edu        Computer Systems Research Institute\\nUUCP:   ..!uunet!dgp.toronto.edu!lansd University of Toronto\\nBitnet:\\t  lansd@dgp.utoronto           Toronto, Ontario M5S 1A4, CANADA\\n',\n",

Features\\n===========\\n\\nDMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:\\n\\n\\n - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard\\n   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)\\n\\n - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display\\n\\n - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)\\n\\n - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale\\n\\n - color-space selection\\n\\n - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required\\n\\n - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)\\n\\n - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for\\n   VGA and many Super-VGAs\\n\\n...\\n\\n4. Technical information\\n========================\\n\\nThe player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].\\nThe IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]\\n(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero\\ncoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT\\n(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'\\nalgorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\\ndifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\\nalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\\nuse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation\\ndominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\\nthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\\n\\nRestricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\\n+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\\nover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\\nis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\\nexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\\n\\nSaturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\\nsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\\nby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\\nconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\\nlower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than\\nto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve\\non NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish\\nareas.\\n\\n...\\n\\n--\\nStefan Eckart, stefan@lis.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de\\n\",\n",

Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere\\nwasn\\'t very fit last year.\\n\\n6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!!\\n7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the\\nseason. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other\\nthan the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks,\\nPatterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have\\npitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money\\non Patterson in stead.\\n\\n8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn\\'t been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.\\n\\n9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.\\n10) Slaught: How come he wasn\\'t given a contract extension last year? NOw his\\nvalue has increased immensely.\\n\\n11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.\\nLet\\'s see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better.\\nNow why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better\\nthan a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won\\'t be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.\\n\\n12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement\\nin favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that\\nidiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.\\n13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The\\nRF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace\\ntwo of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a\\nvery respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have\\na respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit\\nleft handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options\\nfor the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon\\'s tenure was\\ngetting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.\\n\\n14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave.\\nthey will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed.\\nNow, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots,\\nnothing else will.\\n\\nOn a final note. Tim Wakefield won\\'t be as awful as he was in his last 2\\nstarts. BUt don\\'t count on him pitching like last year for the rest of\\nthe season. Also, if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the\\nseason, they will miss Redus\\'s clutch hitting and his speed(he has peaked\\nin the second half of the last 2 seasons)>\\n\\n\\n-Pravin Ratnam\\n',\n",

New software tools for\\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\\n  the development of custom code.)\\n\\nUltimage Concept VI\\n-------------------\\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\\n\\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\\n  characterization.\\n\\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\\n  be imported.\\n\\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects\\' detection, measurement, and\\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\\n  modules.\\n\\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\\n\\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\\n  hole filling.\\n\\n  The program\\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\\n\\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\\n  707-579-1733\\n\\nIPLab Spectrum\\n--------------\\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\\n\\n\\nMacintosh-based tools\\n=====================\\n\\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\\n---------------------------------\\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\\n  from numerical modelling calculations.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\\n\\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\\n  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe\\n  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,\\n  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,\\n  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..\\n\\n  Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA\\n  94039-7900 415-961-4400\\n\\nColorStudio and ImageStudio\\n---------------------------\\n  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has\\n  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and\\n  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to\\n  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The\\n  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can\\n  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.

Image Analyst lets users configure\\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\\n  radiographs.\\n\\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\\n  a disk-stored image.\\n\\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\\n\\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\\n\\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\\n\\nIPLab\\n-----\\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\\n  FAX 703-281-2509\\n\\n  \"Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.\"\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\\n  integrated image analysis.\\n\\nIMAGE\\n-----\\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\\n  image v3.\\n\\n\\n\\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\\n==========================\\n\\nCCD\\n---\\n  Richard Berry\\'s CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\\n  disks with image manipulating software.

It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\\n\\n  Feature description\\n\\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\\n\\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\\n\\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\\n  ``filters\\'\\'.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\\n\\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\\n\\n  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives\\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \\n  palettes can be generated.\\n\\n\\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\\n\\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\\no  image & constant: + - / *\\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.

The most recent\\nresearch  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  State\\nUniversity  School of Criminology.1  He found that  handguns\\nare  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  by\\ncriminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  in\\nthis  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  when\\nyou  consider the number of crimes that never occur  because\\nof  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abiding\\nprivate  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  study\\nof  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39%\\nof  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crime\\nbecause  they believed that the intended victim was  armed.,\\nand  57% agreed that \"most criminals are more worried  about\\nmeeting an armed victim than they are about running into the\\npolice.\"2\\n     One  of the most heinous of crimes is that against  the\\nwomen  of  this country.  It has been my recent  observation\\nthat  more  women  are purchasing handguns  for  defense  in\\nresponse  to  the  present danger of these  assaults.   This\\nshould be taken as encouraging news if the events of Orlando\\nFlorida  are any indicator.  In the late 1960\\'s  the  female\\npopulace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults;  just\\nthe  publicity of the record number of women buying guns and\\nobtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in  rape  for\\nthat  area,  the  only city of its size in  the  country  to\\nexperience a decrease of crime for that year.  Additionally,\\na 1979 US Justice Department study of 32,000 attempted rapes\\nshowed  that overall, when rape is attempted, the completion\\nrate  is 36%. But when a woman defends herself with  a  gun,\\nthe completion rate drops to 3%.\\n \\n1 G Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America Aldine\\nde Gruyter, NY, 1991\\n2 JD Wright & PH Rossi Armed and Considered Dangerous:  A\\nSurvey of Felons and Their Firearms, Aldine de Gruyter, NY,\\n1986\\n-------\\n\\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n[unlike cats] dogs NEVER scratch you when you wash them.

Particularly if a Republican administration had been\\nbehind it.  What\\'s going on here?\\n\\nLet\\'s look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next.\\nI\\'m a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops\\nbecause I\\'ve found some of the techniques to be useful in business\\nnegotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR\\nknows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a\\npsychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had\\nprofessionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh\\'s behavior was\\nemminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from\\ncivilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their\\nisolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh\\'s religious\\norientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as\\nthe apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being\\nconsumed in the apocalypse.\\n\\nIMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated\\npsy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of\\naction designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly\\nappearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the\\ntanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations.\\nThey KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles,\\nobstensibly to perform \"gas insertions\" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push\\nhim over the edge.\\n\\nLook at some supporting evidence.  Koresh\\'s attorney mentioned on TV\\nearlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh\\'s major concern was the biblical\\nrole of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno\\non Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning)\\nclaimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true\\nthey KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they\\nwere pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and\\nreasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at\\nthe first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and\\nwould have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the\\n\"gas insertion\" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image\\nthat will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back\\nand forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.\\n\\nLet\\'s step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without\\nbloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency\\ninterested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation\\nof life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.\\n\\nThe way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back,\\nabandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the\\narmor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited\\nhis ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A\\nsimple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell\\nhow he whipped the US government would have been something he could not\\nhave resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the\\ncompound.

We use it to\\nproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local\\nnetwork.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the\\nimage quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the\\nvideo to the Net.\\n\\nWe also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for\\nuse by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for\\ncommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.\\n\\nThe Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll\\ndigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as\\nan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker\\nof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been\\nunable to deliver.  Our system produces \"near VHS\" quality at 30 fields per\\nsecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60\\nfields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some\\nfind distracting.\\n\\nIf you can get past this problem, you\\'ll find the Adobe Premier editing \\nsoftware quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of\\ndifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.\\n\\nBecause of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you\\'ve ever\\nused (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you\\'ll recognize the methodology\\nand the user interface.\\n\\nThe total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21\" Apple mon-\\nitor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),\\nComposite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.\\n\\nFor you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality\\nthat will satisfy most of your clients.

To start with, lines and\\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\\n\\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\\n\\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\\n\\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\\nthe original problem.\\n\\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\\n\\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\\'s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\\n\\n\\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\\n\\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\\n\\tother words, will it halt?\\n\\n\\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\\n\\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\\n\\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\\n\\tout to be undecidable.\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\\n\\nA couple of references might be:\\n\\n1.

NRA Official Journal 1/89.\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDear sir:\\n\\nBy now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine\\'s publication\\nof small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are\\ndrawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of \\nmomentus \"scientific\" findings. These are regularly released to the press\\nwithout the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and\\noften accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings.\\nGenerally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however\\nmeaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle\\nserious studies by criminologists.\\n\\nThe latest effort -- \"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide:\\nA Tale of Two Cities,\" by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying \\neditorial, \"Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science,\" by two employees\\nof the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult\\nto the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few\\ndata and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length\\nto call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular\\norder.\\n\\n\\t1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to \\n\\tsupport the statement that \"some have argued that restricting\\n\\taccess to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate\\n\\tof homicide.\" Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that\\n\\tcontention.\\n\\t\\n\\t2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very\\n\\tsimilar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,\\n\\tdemographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities\\n\\tare very different with very different demographic characteristics\\n\\twhich appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in\\n\\tSeattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white\\n\\tand *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be\\n\\tthe same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-\\n\\tgrounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various\\n\\tethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.\\n\\t\\n\\t3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada\\'s gun law,\\n\\tcompared to Washington State\\'s. But they do not examine at all\\n\\tthe situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect\\n\\tin 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-\\n\\t1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth\\n\\tinvolving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM\\n\\tarticle there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving\\n\\thandguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that\\n\\tone must look to see the prior situation was before concluding\\n\\tthat a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that\\n\\ta patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day\\n\\tfor seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without\\n\\tat least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?\\n\\t\\n\\t4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national\\n\\tgun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily\\n\\tselected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because\\n\\tit was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific\\n\\treason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which\\n\\tinvolved one experimental subject and one dissimilar \"control\"?\\n\\tHad different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite\\n\\t\"scientific\" conclusions would follow: Vancouver\\'s homicide\\n\\trate *exceeds* that of such \"wild west\" cities in Texas as\\n\\tEl Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado\\n\\tSprings. (Ref. 3)\\n\\t\\n\\t5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or\\n\\thandguns \"are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in\\n\\tVancouver.\" They use two surrogate approaches in pretending\\n\\tto study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is\\n\\tan apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry\\n\\tpermits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in\\n\\tVancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of\\n\\thandguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun\\n\\towners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number\\n\\tof handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns\\n\\tfor the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns\\n\\tlegally for protection, registration figures are\\n\\tmeaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York\\n\\tCity (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,\\n\\tthat method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population\\n\\tin New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver\\n\\thas a greater \"prevalence of weapons\" than New York City.\\n\\t\\n\\tThe second method of measuring gun density is \"Cook\\'s gun\\n\\tprevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity\\n\\tdifferences.\" But the validation was by Cook of his own\\n\\ttheory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a\\n\\tdifferent doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is\\n\\tbased on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement\\n\\tin suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking\\n\\ta measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide\\n\\t(42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in\\n\\thomicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in\\n\\tVancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-\\n\\tability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and\\n\\tVancouver.\\n\\t\\n\\t6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and\\n\\tCanada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that\\n\\tWashington has a waiting period and background check prior to\\n\\tthe purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian\\n\\tlaw for owning and carrying handguns for personal\\n\\tprotection. The authors also make it appear that it is more\\n\\tdifficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually\\n\\tthe case.\\n\\t\\n\\t7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain\\n\\tthe differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the\\n\\tpenalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of \\n\\tclearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a\\n\\tfirearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number\\n\\tof law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making\\n\\tarrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest\\n\\trates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences\\n\\timposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,\\n\\tor gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social\\n\\tscientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,\\n\\tthe authors of the NEJM \"tale of two cities\" fail even to mention\\n\\tmost factors related to crime control.\\n\\t\\n\\t8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective\\n\\tmeans for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not\\n\\tthe case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost\\n\\t650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from\\n\\tcriminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the\\n\\tliklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be\\n\\tcompleted by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury\\n\\tto the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors\\n\\treported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides\\n\\twithout firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle\\n\\taccounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides\\n\\tinvolving firearms.\\n\\t\\n\\t9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the \"study,\"\\n\\teditorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it \"applied\\n\\tscientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb\\n\\tadvocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly\\n\\thandguns.\" There is nothing in the paper which could possibly\\n\\tbe mistaken for \"scientific methods\" by a sociologists or\\n\\tcriminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle \"study\" is the equivolent\\n\\tof testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding\\n\\ttwo ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25\\n\\tand the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,\\n\\tadministering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while\\n\\tgiving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure\\n\\tand, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure, \\n\\tannouncing in a \"special article\" a new medical breakthrough.\\n\\tIt would be nice to think that such a \"study\" would neither be\\n\\tfunded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.\\n\\t\\n\\tSince the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC\\n\\tmake them willing to present shoddy research as \"scientific\\n\\tbreakthroughs\" in \"special articles\" and editorials relating\\n\\tto firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying\\n\\tthe news media and those with congressional and executive oversight\\n\\tover the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about\\n\\tthe distortions contained in \"Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,\\n\\tand Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities\" and \"Firearm Injuries: A Call\\n\\tfor Science.\" Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside\\n\\twhenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize\\n\\tan opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.\\n\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tREFERENCES\\n\\n1.

Wright\\n          (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)\\n\\n   suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.\"  The problem is demonstrated\\n   by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting\\n   to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by\\n   the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal\\n   of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and\\n   suggested that a handgun ban \"may reduce the rate of homicide in a \\n   community.\"\\n      The nine medical doctors who published \"Handgun Regulations, Crime,\\n   Assaults, and Homicide\" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite\\n   many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver\\n   has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations\\n   make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems\\n   indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period\\n   1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.\\n   Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,\\n   Why?\\n      The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case\\n   to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,\\n   that Vancouver\\'s handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their\\n   evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and \\n   unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point\\n   does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support\\n   of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody\\n   knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We\\n   are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that\\n   a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates\\n   when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.\\n      Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two\\n   indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-\\n   weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons\\n   permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the\\n   permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable.\\n*     The second bit of evidence is \"Cook\\'s gun prevalence index,\" which stands\\n*  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook\\'s index\\n*  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in \\n*  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage\\n*  of homicides and suicides involving firearms.\\n*     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides,\\n*  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take\\n*  Cook\\'s index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be\\n*  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides\\n*  is directly related to their relative availability in the general \\n*  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To\\n*  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to \"prove\" it on the basis of\\n*  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.\\n      Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that\\n   guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.\\n   The authors attribute Seattle\\'s higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun\\n   ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates\\n   reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,\\n   that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.\\n      In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain\\'s low rate of\\n   violent crime was a function of that nation\\'s strict gun laws and the \\n   consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin \\n   Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime\\n   for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke\\n   an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.\\n      Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data\\n   on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are \"similar in\\n   many ways,\" implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law\\n   stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish\\n   the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that \"all\\n   else is equal\" among things being compared.\\n*     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look \\n*  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime\\n*  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage\\n*  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle\\n*  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent.\\n*  Vancouver\\'s minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the\\n*  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half-\\n*  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown\\n*  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out.\\n*     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is\\n*  particularly relevant in light of the study\\'s breakdown of homicide rates\\n*  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide\\n*  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver.\\n*  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due\\n*  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks,\\n*  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics\\n*  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison\\n*  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial\\n*  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle\\n*  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain\\n*  in either city.\\n      Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the\\n   cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority \\n   groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in \"gun availability\"\\n   (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not\\n   matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why\\n   blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed\\n   in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,\\n   do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)\\n      Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between\\n   Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have \\n   anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol \\n   abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty\\'s minority population?  (The city\\n   of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the \\n   Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the\\n   United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian\\n   percentage?\\n      The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many\\n   ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent\\n   more detailed analysis, nearly any of these \"many ways\" might explain part\\n   or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such\\n   as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal.\\n*     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide\\n*  result in a \"complex picture.\"  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing\\n*  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They\\n*  also acknowledge that \"socio-economic status is probably an important\\n*  confounding factor in our comparison,\" remarking further that \"blacks   \\n*  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of\\n*  Vancouver\\'s population.\"  Given the evidence presented in the article,\\n*  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle\\n*  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle\\'s racial\\n*  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility,\\n*  since \"detailed information about household incomes according to race\\n*  is not available for Vancouver.\"\\n      The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in \\n   gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple\\n   example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms\\n   of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one \\n   would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.\\n   Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce \\n   crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into\\n   account?  In this example, the \"hidden variable\" is city size: Guns are\\n   more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city\\n   problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the\\n   appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very\\n   seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities\\n   for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,\\n   and their results are impossible to interpret.\\n      In the editorial \"Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science\" accompanying\\n   the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the\\n   authors for applying \"scientific methods\" to a problem of grave public\\n   heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from\\n   nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate\\n   plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them\\n   out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are\\n   little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this\\n   study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical\\n   identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--\\n   is cause for further concern.\\n\\n   [James D.

One of his best throwaway lines was to\\nremind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been\\nchecked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the\\npeople in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of\\n\"election fraud\" to hold their jobs.\\n\\nNancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and\\nsheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and\\ntelling people where to find their own representatives (and in too\\nmany cases, who they were).\\n\\nMike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and\\ndiscuss a bill that hadn\\'t made it onto the official list.  It seems a\\ndelegation of students from Simon\\'s Rock of Bard College (alma mater\\nof Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was\\nbeing bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or\\nammo to anyone who is not a state resident.\\n\\nThe hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner\\nAuditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor\\'s\\nhearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive\\nhusbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole\\nour representatives, after which we would be squashed into an\\ninadequate hearing room.\\n\\nOne of my representatives\\' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy.\\nHe said, \"Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is\\nalways so organized every year.\"  I got a little pissed, and replied,\\n\"I\\'m not from the gun lobby -- I\\'m from your district.\"\\n\\nAt 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a\\ndemonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the\\npro-gunners weren\\'t).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his\\nmirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and\\nseveral Simon\\'s Rock anti-gun \"close-the-loophole\" protestors.\\n(Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)\\n\\nThe room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were\\nabout 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers\\nfrom Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got\\ncloser than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A\\ncop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the\\ncrowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker\\nwas set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.\\n\\nEveryone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet\\nsaying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up\\nto \"support GOAL\\'s position\" on \"all bills.\"\\n\\nFirst, because of their time constraints, public officials got to\\ntestify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students\\nhad some curfew, I guess).  \\n\\nCurrently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long\\nguns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of\\nhis own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to\\nnon-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon\\'s Rock\\nfolks called the current law a \"loophole\" and wanted it closed.\\n\\nTwo of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \"SKS assault rifle.\"\\nThe second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well\\nthat he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo\\'s home state) with Missouri,\\nand became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery\\ncorrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed\\nthat the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was\\nlying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining\\nstates ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \"as strong as\"\\nthat in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that\\'s that.\\n\\nSome of the things these two said were really offensive.  \"In some of\\nthese other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he\\'s breathing!\"\\n(Oooooo!)  \"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if\\nonly the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn\\'t\\nbe having this situation -- but they won\\'t.\"  (Naughty, naughty!)\\n\\nNext up was Boston city councilman Albert \"Dapper\" O\\'Neill.  He was\\nthere to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He\\'s\\nreasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he\\'s\\nalmost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the\\nACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were\\njudge, he\\'d give arrestees their \"last rights\" (pun intended) on the\\nspot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.)\\nHe said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the\\nright direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(\\n\\nTwo of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a\\nCCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a\\nrestraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining\\norder requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction\\n-- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor\\nof it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying,\\n\"I\\'m sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to\\nget these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have\\nconvicted.\"  I haven\\'t seen such a disgustingly disingenuous\\nperformance since Nixon whined that he wasn\\'t a crook.\\n\\nBarrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable\\nevery five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated\\npurpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible.\\n\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some\\ncongressmen think we\\'re stupid enough to swallow the argument that\\nit\\'s preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the\\nvague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn\\ncard away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the\\nlaw-abiding instead of the crook.\\n\\nThe two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga.\\nJujuga didn\\'t say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \"restraining\\norder\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn\\'t let any\\nbad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He \\nwas a co-sponsor of one of the \"restraining order\" bills as well.)  One\\nof the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was\\nvociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in\\nthe right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \"every\\nyear it\\'s the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\"\\nIt\\'s nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been\\nmore effective.\\n\\nAt about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn\\'t continue.\\nSomeone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because\\nthe loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was\\ndisconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had\\nto leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \"public\"\\ntestimony; the other got a seat this time.\\n\\nCaron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the\\nstate, and then returned without notifying them of his address change.\\nHe complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that\\nhis PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great\\nquote: \"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state\\ncomputer system until 1999.\"  (This was also an argument he used\\nagainst the renewable FID card.)\\n\\nTestimony was heard from several \"battered women,\" one of whom had\\nbeen attacked by some guy in his 20\\'s who had an FID card because he\\ngot it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and\\nsaid how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General\\nHarshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how\\n50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women\\nneeded to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was\\ngranted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether\\nthe order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be\\nsatisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather\\nthan after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long\\nrambling circumlocution in response.\\n\\nThen testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks\\nsomething like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining\\norders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue\\nrestraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they\\nthink is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining\\norders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts.\\nAtty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.\\n\\nOther pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a\\nrestraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she\\ncountered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have\\nallowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law.\\nOne of the junior reps noted that \"this is America\" and we have to be\\ncertain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga\\nreiterated this, saying that \"people who abuse smaller people can go\\nto Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating\\nconviction with a restraining order.\"  (Point and match, Senator.)\\n\\nAnother pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn\\'t know his\\ncitizenship \"expired every 5 years,\" and that a driver\\'s license was a\\nprivilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.\\n\\nA third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice\\nsystem, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public\\nhangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death\\npenalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public\\nhangings.  The speaker then responded, \"I\\'ll make you a deal.  You get\\nme the rope, and I\\'ll tie the noose.\"\\n\\nNext came public testimony on the Simon\\'s Rock bill.  A teacher\\ntestified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \"he\\nwouldn\\'t have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was\\noutside\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \"loophole\" should be\\nclosed to prevent something like this from \"ever happening again\".\\n\\nFour or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of\\nspilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually\\nshot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on,\\nsaying, \"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are\\nsafe -- support gun control.\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or\\ncorrect the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had\\nclaimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \"Only residents can get\\nFID\\'s,\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no\\nidea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut\\nout-of-staters completely off?)\\n\\nYacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as\\nwritten would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by\\nout-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could\\nbe put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary\\nsomewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino\\nunderscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident\\nstudent -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental\\nrecord.\\n\\nOne junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy\\na gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \"elitist\".  Another\\n(Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents\\nfrom buying without an FID because only two other states in the union\\nhad \"FID-type\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one\\'s home\\nstate was \"not enough.\"  One pro-gun speaker replied that this\\nresembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming,\\n\"Everyone\\'s out of step but Johnny!\"\\n\\nAll the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony\\nfor this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the\\nother bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and\\nGOAL\\'s position) were:\\n\\no  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull \\n   licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)\\n\\no  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)\\n\\no  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly\\n   opposed)\\n\\no  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws \\n   (opposed)\\n\\no  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)\\n\\no  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)\\n\\no  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)\\n\\no  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)\\n\\no  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)\\n\\nSome of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining\\npro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.\\n\\nMike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger\\nlock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee\\nto carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.\\n\\nCaron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it.\\nAgain, he brought up the state\\'s archaic records capability and said,\\n\"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\"\\n\\nThe session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it\\ncould not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.

Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.\\n\\nThe day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy\\nMarshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although\\nSpence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy\\nmust involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is\\nthe government\\'s only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.\\nSpence attacked Cooper\\'s credibility by pointing out discrepancies\\nbetween Cooper\\'s statements last September and those made in court.\\nCooper conceded that, \"You have all these things compressed into\\na few seconds...It\\'s difficult to remember what went on first.\"\\n\\nCooper acknowledged that he carried a \"9mm Colt Commando submachine\\ngun with a silenced barrel.\" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!]\\nCooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific\\nplans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver\\'s dog.\\n\\nWhen Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan\\'s\\nM-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for\\nsure that Degan did not return fire before going down.\\n\\nSpence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)\\nhad Cooper discussed last August\\'s events, Cooper responded, \"If\\nyou\\'re implying that we got our story together, you\\'re wrong,\\ncounselor.\"  Spence continued to advance the defense\\'s version of\\nthe events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by\\nkilling the Weaver\\'s dog.  Cooper disagreed.\\n\\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence\\'s\\nvirulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions\\nwere repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained \\nthat Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the\\ndefense\\'s version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge\\nsustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted\\nuntil Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to\\nadmonish both attorneys.  \"I\\'m not going to play games with either\\ncounsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start\\nacting like professionals.\"\\n\\nSpence told the judge that, \"When all the evidence is in, we\\'ll see\\nthat ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that\\nhe was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.\" \\nSpence continued, \"We\\'re going to find...that there is a very unlikely\\nsimilarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between\\nthe testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.\"\\n\\nSpence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen\\'s repeated\\nobjections would prevent a fair trial, \"We can\\'t have a fair trial if the\\njury believes I\\'m some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I\\'m\\nbending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I\\'m\\nviolating court orders.\"\\n\\nJudge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen\\'s\\nobjections had somehow prejudiced the jury was \"preposterous\" and\\ndenied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict\\nhis comments when objecting.\\n\\nThe trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg\\nRampton.  The prosecution\\'s purpose was simply to introduce five\\nweapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized\\non the opportunity to further address Cooper\\'s credibility.\\n\\nDefense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris\\' other attorney) questioned\\nRampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific\\nplans to kill the Weaver\\'s dog without being detected.  Matthews then\\nhad Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton\\nhad said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon\\nwas to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them.\\nRampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that,\\nbut he could not remember when.  He then stated that, \"I did not conduct\\nthe primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations\\nwith him since the interview was conducted.\"\\n\\nMonday, April 19, 1993 will begin the fifth day of the trial.

       " \"Sorry I missed you Raymond, I was just out in Dahlgren last month...\\n\\nI'm the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics, so perhaps I\\ncan help a little.\\n\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\\nper second).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\\ndata representations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \\nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\\neven SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\\n\\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

Darryl, racing over from right center, got to\\nthe spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he\\nmissed the ball.

Home run.\\n\\nNow I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that\\nDarryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially\\nbehind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate\\nvicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with\\nStrawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan\\nwho caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious\\nto where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as\\nsoon as he realized he had made the catch.\\n\\nThat exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry\\nwent into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot\\nof profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of\\ncosting the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled\\nfood and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium\\nofficials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and\\njust relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,\\nLasorda blamed the fan for the loss.

All homicides must be shown, per capita, not  \\n: just handguns.  The availability of them in the USA makes them the preferred  \\n: murder weapon, but ban them, and some other weapon will step in as the  \\n: favorite.\\n\\nAs a \"favorite\", sure.  As lethal, not likely.  A study of violence in\\nChicago produced this table:\\n\\n\\t\\tPercentage of Reported Gun and Knife Attacks\\n\\t\\t\\t    Resulting in Death\\n\\t\\t\\t    \\n\\tWeapon\\t\\t\\t\\tDeaths As Percentage of Attacks\\n\\t---------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\tKnives (16,518 total attacks)\\t\\t 2.4\\n\\tGuns (6,350 total attacks)\\t\\t12.2\\n\\n\\tSource: Firearms and Violence in American Life\\n\\t\\nIt might be contended that if gun murderers were deprived of guns\\nthat they would find a way to kill as often with knives.  If this were\\nso, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide\\nwould be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in\\ncities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show\\na higher fatality rate.  But the Nat\\'l Commission on the Causes and\\nPrevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this\\nnot to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife\\nattacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks\\n(which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants),\\nthe proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the\\nproportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.\\n\\nWhat was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on\\nthe part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended\\nto show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave\\nphysical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the\\nhead neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this\\npattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of\\nrage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.\\n\\n\\tSource: Report on Firearms and Violence\\n\\n: Then, since England != USA (my ancestors left because of the oppression) you  \\n: must compare England before strict gun laws to England after strict gun laws to  \\n: be able to draw any meaning at all.  England has essentially legalized drugs,  \\n: so there are no drug gangs battling for turf, etc., there.  If you drop out the  \\n: drug related killings here, the USA would look a whole lot more peaceful.\\n\\nThere are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually, I\\'m not\\nfond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and\\nAmericans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic\\ndifferences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found\\nmyself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I\\ndon\\'t think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent\\ncrime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every\\nlaw-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.\\n\\nOn the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more\\nculturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive,\\nseven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates\\nof Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities\\nwith roughly the same population, urban economy, geography\\nand crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.\\n\\nIn Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After\\na 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed\\nweapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.\\n\\nIn Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason\\nto purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted.\\nRecreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are\\nregulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a\\nrestricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in\\norder to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns\\ntransported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box.\\nIn short, gun control but not unreasonably so.\\n\\nBoth cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for\\ngun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers\\nstudied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated),\\nburglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from\\n1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same\\nstandard: the FBI\\'s Unified Crime Report.\\n\\nResults: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in\\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver\\n(1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99).\\n18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in\\nVancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in\\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 /\\n1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher\\n(1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by\\nweapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged.\\nAlthough both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated\\nassault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were\\nfar more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.\\n\\nOver the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle\\n(11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000).\\nAfter adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations,\\nthe relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as\\ncompared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.\\n\\nWhen homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate\\nof homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in\\nSeattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver.\\nVirtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to\\na more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns\\naccounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns\\nwere 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than\\nin Vancouver.\\n\\nThe authors of the report also investigated \"legally justifiable\"\\nhomicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during\\nthe seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only\\n21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in\\nSeattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After\\nexcluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these\\nearlier findings.\\n\\n-------\\n\\nThis is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the\\nargument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because\\nVancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times\\nthat of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports\\nannual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC,\\nChicago, Los Angeles and Houston.\\n\\nCritics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access\\nto handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because\\npersons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a\\ngun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently.\\nIf the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by\\nthe strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we\\ncould expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to\\nbe higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study\\ninterval, Vancouver\\'s rate of homicide by weapons other than guns\\nwas not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that\\nfew would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.\\n\\nAs well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding\\ncitizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did\\nexperience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these\\ncases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities\\nduring the course of the study period.  And, as was reported,\\nSeattle apparently didn\\'t enjoy relief from any crime category\\nover Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for\\nself-defense.\\n\\n\\tHeavily quoted source: Handgun Regulation, Crime,\\n\\tAssaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities.\\n\\n\\tJohn H.

To me they al suffer from the fundamental\\nflaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing\\nthe responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user.\\nPerhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault\\nrifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has\\nonly range and acurracy going for it.\\n\\n\\n\\tI disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much\\nmore easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that word\\nwould get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this\\nis not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change\\nquite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians\\nintent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The\\nbalancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.\\n\\n\\n\\tThat seems to be the case already, given that heavy\\nweapons aren\\'t commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low\\nnumbers, obviously due to cost, I don\\'t think the superior\\nweapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically\\nsuperior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training\\nincludes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks,\\nwhereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.\\n\\n\\n\\tI had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers\\nof a select group, and the like would exercise control over the\\nheavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman\\ntank I certainly wouldn\\'t ask him to give it up.  Follow orders\\nfrom the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large,\\nthough, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should\\ntherefore be jointly maintained and operated.\\n\\n\\n\\tThis I\\'ll agree with to a point.  The State having control\\nover the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state\\nto have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that\\nthe ability of the State to lock them up isn\\'t so easy.  Otherwise,\\nI would have to assume that State control would rest on the\\nauthority of the Governor and militia officers.\\n\\n\\n\\tI\\'m having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons,\\nfairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few\\npeople with government support.  Just as you argued above that\\nthe weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control\\nso one side doesn\\'t have all of them, I can\\'t see where this\\nsituation is alleviated in having the select militia holding\\nall the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry.\\nI think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that\\nthe Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the\\nunorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.\\n\\n\\n\\tWe have to assume that there would be those who would\\nside with the government-controlled forces, and if they\\'ve all\\nthe equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble.\\nI\\'d like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the\\nlocal troups having a few 105\\'s and anti-tank weapons in their\\narmory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than the\\ntank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in.\\nI suppose I\\'m quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.\\n\\n\\n\\tSo would I, but the resources often aren\\'t available to\\noutfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to\\ncall in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster\\nthan anything else.\\n\\n\\n\\tPerhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think\\nmain battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up\\nfield pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton\\ntrucks, HumVee\\'s, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff\\nof a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units\\nin Iowa are currently fielding in some units.\\n\\n\\tPerhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy\\nequipment under State control, with little but numbers and light\\nstuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the\\nstates should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local\\nranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly,\\nhence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally,\\nthe militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for\\nother responses.  The Federal army, I\\'m convinced, should have a\\nvery minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias\\nfor these functions.\\n\\n< Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu >\\n<  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

       " '\\nIt helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion - or at least\\na reasonable model of the class of distortion.  Below is a very short\\ndescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,\\nfeel free to poke me via e-mail.\\n\\n================================================================\\n*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion\\n\\n0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This\\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\\n   Consider deleting these edges.\\n\\n1) Now, there are two goals:\\n\\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\\'s)\\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \\n       using the digitized (x,y)\\'s).\\n\\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\\n   example:\\n\\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\\n       Reference(x,y). \\n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\\n       the correct length (where \"correct\" is the DigitizedLength). \\n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\\n\\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\\n\\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\\nof the edges.\\n\\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\\nobserved (essentially, you can\\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\\nyou can\\'t allow triangles to \"fold over\" neighboring triangles.  Both of\\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \\nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and\\nchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I\\n*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more\\ncompute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having\\nevery point interact with every other point....but first read up on\\nlinear solutions to the n-body problem.\\n\\nThere are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings on\\nsprings, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.

       " '[deleted]\\n[]       And as far as fully-automatic weapons, you can be a lot better\\n[]armed if you want to hit what you aim at.\\n[]\\n\\nDefine \"armed better\". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the\\nColt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which\\nfaster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other\\nguys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson\\nin hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it\\'s M-16 now to\\n3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops\\nlike to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something\\noften in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).\\n\\nA revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.\\n\\n- A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull\\n  the trigger again.\\n- A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,\\n  but will fire merely by pulling the trigger.\\n- A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again\\n  to rotate to the next round.\\n- A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the\\n  hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an\\n  easy motion, even one handed.\\n- Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines\\n  on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.\\n\\n- A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell\\n  first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often\\n  lost as you realize \"hey, it\\'s jammed!\" before starting to do anything\\n  about clearing it.\\n- Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round\\n  and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the \\n  chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider\\n  this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed\\n  of employment as a revolver.\\n- There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of\\n  operation of many of them requires more training.\\n\\nSome police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly\\nswitching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having\\naccidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks\\nrequire rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex\\nas the timer on a VCR.\\n\\nAnyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun\\nthe police don\\'t know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter\\nand pay attention. I do not seek here to say \"semi-autos are junk\"\\nmerely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop\\nwith a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than\\nequipped for anything short of a riot.\\n\\nGun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a \\nwonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don\\'t hit anything.\\nGood controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit.\\nI own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon\\nto something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven\\'t hit\\nwhat I\\'m aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously\\nwrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of those\\nextra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in\\ncriminal encounters is less than 5.\\n\\nWhat do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple\\n.38 revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police \\nprefer the much heftier .357 Magnum, but anyway.....\\n\\nObPlea: Don\\'t flame me, I prefer semi-autos for most things.

The following basic support is\\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\\n\\n    o Transparent Client Management\\n\\n    o Client Message Handling\\n\\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\\naccepting and\\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\\napplication writer\\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\\n\\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\\n\\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\\n        initialisers you want.\\n\\n    o Event Handler Registration:\\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\\n\\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\\n\\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\\n    from which to choose.\\n\\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\\n\\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\\n        any initialization you want to do.\\n\\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\\n\\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\\n\\n    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\\n    three world servers I've provided:\\n\\n        generic - 81 lines\\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\\n                           stairs! Will probably be improved with future\\n                           versions)\\n        dogfight - 72 lines\\n\\nLocation:\\n\\n   This software is located at the following site:\\n   ftp.u.washington.edu\\n\\n   Directory:\\n   pub/virtual-worlds\\n\\n   File:\\n   multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z\\n\\nFutures:\\n\\n   Client:\\n\\n    o Texture mapping.\\n\\n    o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading\\n\\n    o HMD support.\\n\\n    o Etc, etc....\\n\\n   Server:\\n\\n    o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).\\n\\n    o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction\\n\\n    o Etc, etc....\\n\\n   Both:\\n\\n    o Improved Comms!!!\\n\\nI hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse\\nsoftware,\\nunfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure\\nwhether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(\\n\\nI hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of\\nthe Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I\\nwould *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!\\n\\nFinally one major disclaimer:\\n\\nThis is totally amateur code. By that I mean there is no support for this code\\nother than what I, out the kindness of my heart, or you, out of pure\\ndesperation, provide. I cannot be held responsible for anything good or bad\\nthat may happen through the use of this code - USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!\\n\\nDisclaimer over!\\n\\nOf course if you love it, I would like to here from you.

I hear\\nthe FAN at night wherever I go (the signal used to be WNBC, when they\\nplayed golden oldies) because you can't avoid it.  Of those three,\\nWIP has the best hosts hands down.  Chuck Cooperstein isn't a homer,\\nand neither is Jody Mac.  WTEM is too generic to be placed in the\\ncatergory.  In fact if you have heard WTEM and the FAN you notice the\\ntheme music is identical...same ownership?? I think so!  WIP is\\ntotally original.  Their hosts actually have a personality (this is a\\nknock at TEM (the TEAM) not the FAN because Mike and the Mad Dog and\\nSommers are good) I mean comparing the morning guys in Philadelphia\\nto the ones in Washington is a total joke.  Anyway, I like the FAN\\nand WIP, but I think the edge goes to 'IP.  \\n\\nWhen I get back from Philly, I go into withdraw cause Richmond has\\nnada except the national sports line (and those guys are totally\\nclueless)   \\nI was really mad when WCAU was cancelled because they had Steve\\nFredericks doing sports phone after the Phillies games.  (WCAU is\\nanother strong station, now it's an oldies station, but they still\\nhave the Phillies) I started listening to the FAN because I heard he\\nwent there.  I finally heard him last summer and he wasn't the same\\nguy.  Those NY fans got to him.  I was glad to hear him back in\\nPhilly when I went to see a few Eagles games.  \\n\\n\\nI will admit, I am  die hard EAGLES fan and WIP is basically an\\nEagles station 365 days a year.  BUT, I bet you the Phillies are in\\ncontrol right now.\\n\\n\\nAbout the knock on G. Cobb, I like him.  He knows the Eagles like a\\nbook.  I remember the weekend before they went to play San Fran,\\n(when everyone thought the Eagles would be blown away) Cobb said that\\nthe Eagles usually play their best when no one believe they can win.\\nWell they were inches shy of pulling the victory.  \\n\\nWell that's my $.02\\n\",\n",

This directory can be used for things like\\narticles by Kates, Wright, Tonso, Levinson, Supreme Court Decisions,\\nthe RIA vs US decision, copies of legislation, and so on.  It\\'s not\\nmeant to be for the discussions that normally appear here.\\n\\nSo, in the future if you\\'re looking for something check there first\\nand then ask here.\\n\\nInstructions:\\n\\nShort version for techies:\\n\\nThe site is godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu.  Place contributions into the\\ndirectory /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba.  The ftp commands\\nget, put, mget, or mput should work.  Give the command \"type binary\"\\nto be sure files are transferred correctly.  Your files will be moved\\nto the rkba directory.  To get a file use the commands get or mget.\\n\\nI will maintain an index which you should get first to check if\\nthe file you want to read or write already is archived.\\n\\nLong version for non-techies:\\n\\nIn order for you to use this archive your computer must be on\\nthe Internet.  To connect to the archive site run the command:\\n\\n\\tftp godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu\\n\\nIf that doesn\\'t work you cannot use this archive.  If the ftp\\ncommand is successful you\\'ll get this prompt asking you for a\\nlogin:\\n\\tName (godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu:lvc):\\n\\nInstead of lvc your initials will appear.  Answer this prompt with:\\n\\n\\tftp\\n\\nNext you\\'ll get this prompt asking your for your e-mail address:\\n\\n\\tGuest login ok, send e-mail address as password:\\n\\nI would enter:\\n\\n\\tl.v.cipriani@att.com\\n\\nYou\\'ll enter your own e-mail address.  You\\'ll get these lines\\nor similar as output:\\n\\n\\tRemote system is UNIX.\\n\\tUsing binary mode to transfer files.\\n\\nNext, the command prompt is printed:\\n\\n\\tftp> \\n\\nIf you do not get the line \"Using binary mode to transfer files.\"\\nRun the command:\\n\\n\\ttype binary\\n\\nNow you\\'re logged in to the archive machine.  There are many\\ndirectories on this machine  but the two you are concerned with are\\n\\n\\t/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba\\nand\\n\\t/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming\\n\\nThere are subdirectories to the rkba directory, those are discussed below.\\n\\nWhen you login to the system your directory is /usr0/anon.  To retreive\\nfiles change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command:\\n\\n\\tcd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba\\nor\\n\\tcd pub/firearms/politics/rkba\\n\\nTo submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with\\nthe command:\\n\\n\\tcd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming\\nor\\n\\tcd pub/firearms/politics/incoming\\n\\nOnce you do this you\\'ll get another ftp> prompt asking you to enter\\nanother command.\\n\\nTo find the names of the existing files in the directory you are\\nin run the command:\\n\\n\\tls -l\\n\\nThis will produce something like:\\n\\ntotal 6021\\n-r--r--r--  1 karl          6932 Jun 16  1992 DMN_Gratia_CCP\\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         69149 Apr  5 19:20 INDEX\\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         18965 Jun 16  1992 Knox_AW_lies\\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         10930 Apr 30  1992 S361\\n-r--r--r--  1 karl          8958 Jun 16  1992 WSJ_Crimestrike\\n-r--r--r--  1 karl          2649 Jan 13 18:33 academia-bias\\n-r--r--r--  1 karl           935 Mar 22 22:38 academics\\n-r--r--r--  1 karl         36079 Aug  4  1992 aclu\\n... and so on ...\\n\\nEach line corresponds to one file.  Reading right to left, the fields\\nare the file name, the last modification date of the file, the size of\\nthe file in bytes, and some permission fields which you do not need\\nto be concerned with.\\n\\nTo get a file run the command \"get\" followed by the name of the file\\nyou want, for example:\\n\\n\\tget INDEX\\nor\\n\\tget noduty\\n\\nAfter the file is transfered to your machine a message like this:\\n\\n\\tTransfer complete.\\n\\t19580 bytes received in 5 seconds (4 Kbytes/s)\\n\\nYou can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive.\\nYou can use the mget command to retreive multiple files.  If the\\nfile you want is in a subdirectory, for example, congress/103rd/HR1025\\nyou should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first\\nand then retrieve it:\\n\\n\\tcd congress/103rd\\n\\tget HR1025\\n\\nOnce you\\'re finished you can log off with the command:\\n\\n\\tquit\\n\\nIf you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little\\ndifferent.  First of all you should find out if the file already\\nexists, so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above\\nand look it over to make sure you wouldn\\'t repeat an entry.  The\\nindex will have a description of each of the files in the rkba\\ndirectory.  For example:\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nFile: whitemanslaw\\n\\nWhite Man\\'s Law by William R. Tonso, from the December 1985\\nReason magazine\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve determined you won\\'t be duplicating an entry, login\\nand change to the incoming directory command (see above).  Once\\nyou are in the incoming directory use the command:\\n\\n\\tput file_name\\n\\nIn this case:\\n\\n\\tput whitemanslaw\\n\\nAgain there\\'ll be a \"Transfer complete, so many bytes transfered\\nin so many seconds\" message.  Now your file is on the archive\\nmachine.\\n\\nAnother thing to watch out for is duplicate file /names/.  Be sure\\nthere isn\\'t a file in the incoming directory that is called the same\\nas the file you want to write.  If you use the same name you\\'ll\\noverwrite the previous file [or you\\'ll get an error message].\\n\\nYour file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a\\nfile by the same name in the rkba directory.\\n\\nOnce your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for\\nthe INDEX file and I will add it to the file.\\n\\nIf you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute\\na file email the file to me and I\\'ll take care of the rest.\\n\\nIf you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed, so\\nbe sure to let me know first.\\n\\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask me.\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n-- \\nLarry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\nMichael Phelps, (external) mjp@vnet.ibm.com ..\\n                (internal) mjp@bwa.kgn.ibm.com .. mjp at kgnvmy         \\n (and last but not least a disclaimer)  These opinions are mine..       \\n',\n",

It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked \\nat players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they\\nwere 24, and noticed some interesting things. \\n\\n  For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in\\nthe history of the game. They also found out such players represented the\\nmajority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that\\nthey actually did some number-crunching and found that such players\\' careers\\nlasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also  \\nfound that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and\\nproduced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The first\\ngroup outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew away\\nthe second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc. \\n\\n  It was the most impressive thing I\\'ve seen on ESPN in recent memory. \\n\\n  I guess Ray Knight makes his rebuttal tonight. \\n \\n-- \\nDave Hung Like a Jim Acker Slider Kirsch      Blue Jays - Do it again in \\'93 \\nkirsch@staff.tc.umn.edu                        New .. quotes out of context!\\n\"Not to beat a dead horse, but it\\'s been a couple o\\' weeks .. this \\n disappoints me..punishments..discharges..jackhammering..\" - Stephen Lawrence \\n',\n",

The explanation\\n   we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult\\n   members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit\\n   of idiocy is that if you\\'re going to operate as a quasi-military unit,\\n   you\\'d better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule\\n   is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is\\n   incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.\\n\\n2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were\\n   outgunned, they didn\\'t expect such heavy resistance.  When\\n   questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault\\n   was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were\\n   thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew\\n   you could!\\n\\n3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,\\n   hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and\\n   referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I\\'m\\n   more than ever convinced that\\'s right on target.  An anecdote not\\n   related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up\\n   some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There\\'s\\n   now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by\\n   the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I\\n   was told this by a relative of my wife\\'s who happens to be an FBI\\n   agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let\\'s just say\\n   uncomplimentary.\\n\\n4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that\\n   the BD\\'s had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the\\n   reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we\\'re *still* hearing\\n   this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references\\n   to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around\\n   the \"He\\'s a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!\"\\n   flag.  Sigh.\\n\\n5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege\\n   reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought\\n   processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button\\n   because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My\\n   only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to\\n   the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to\\n   an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in\\n   the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I\\'d expect the\\n   forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In\\n   that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones\\n   Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:\\n   Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and\\n   other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the\\n   BD\\'s feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have\\n   been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.

       " '\\nI agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result\\nin 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400%\\ndoes not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would\\nrather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in\\neach of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning\\nby .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious\\npositive association between John\\'s statistic and winning games.  Thus,\\nbefore you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must\\ngo into what sort of relationship there is.\\n\\n\\nThe only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly\\nhow many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many\\nseasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players\\nperformance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a\\nplayer who gets an out gets a \"negative probability\" in most cases.\\nThus, I\\'m not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers\\nfor a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,\\nthey will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,\\nthe pitchers\\' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given\\nthem a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that\\npulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would\\nthink however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning\\nwould be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score \\nin the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually\\ncomes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue\\nthat any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance\\nto those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs\\noften means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter\\nwho gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The\\noffence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not\\nsaying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If\\nI am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many\\nruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       \\n\\n\\n\\nNo, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would\\nbe 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,\\nif you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high\\nprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the\\nball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,\\nfouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \"negative chance\" that the team\\nwould win.\\n \\nFrom reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those\\nwho critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.\\nAt first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really\\ndoes not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players\\nin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance\\ngoes down.  I\\'ve never seen convincing proof that this really happens.\\nSo, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except\\nfor a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to\\nplayer performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you\\ndo not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what\\nthe average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for\\ninstance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%\\non average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.\\nI bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just\\nas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.\\n\\nHow do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the\\nexact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K\\'s, BB\\'s,\\netc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched\\nin closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more\\nvaluble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better \\npitcher?  They were probably about the same.\\n\\n                                                        Brian Smith\\n',\n",

What may not be equally obvious is that there are \\npoliticians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase \\n\"political science\" is subject to more than one interpretation.  \\n\\nYears ago, we heard how \"scientists\" were worried that a new Ice \\nAge might be coming, and later on that \"nuclear winter\" -- smoke \\nand dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international \\nunpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even \\nhave killed the dinosaurs.  \\n\\nWhat we didn\\'t hear was that no actual data supported any of this, \\nthat real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended \\nto discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken \\nvalues that made America the most successful culture in history, \\nand that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague \\nwhen continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.  \\n\\nWe miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William \\nSound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen\\'s weren\\'t \\nsupposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least \\n100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you\\'d never \\nknow it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn\\'t fit \\ntheir agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and \\nthat nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.  \\n\\nBut for once, the media aren\\'t entirely to blame.  As ignorant of \\nscience as they are of everything, they trust \"scientists\" to \\nunscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today\\'s \"scientists\" \\nhave agendas of their own.  \\n\\nNobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is \\ngoing to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that \\nthere is no respectable evidence for \"global warming\".  The money \\nand power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and \\nthey hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical \\ncrisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.  \\n\\nThe same appears true of \"acid rain\", a deliberate hoax cooked up \\nby the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private \\nindustrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and \\nfoisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on \\nspecialists in different fields not talking to each other much.  \\n\\nThe list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.  \\n\"Ozone depletion\", for which evidence is even more suspect and \\ncontradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than \\na last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era \\nwhen state central planning and the command economy have failed and \\ncan only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.  \\n\\nDecades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth \\nand panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear \\npower is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy \\nknown to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount \\nof energy there is available to any individual in society, the \\nfreer that individual -- and his society -- become.  \\n\\nHonest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and \\nself-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as \\nideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive \\nreductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have \\nbeen suppressed, most recently by the California state government.  \\n\\nAnd what the media didn\\'t say about recent EPA \"discoveries\" on the \\neffect of \"secondhand smoking\" is that, although some harm to non-\\nsmokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of \\nmagnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a \\nweek or keeping a pet bird.  It\\'s enough to make you wonder whether \\nthere was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.  \\n\\nThat, of course, is the real threat represented by politically \\ncorrect science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice \\nto know the hazards.  I\\'ve never believed smoking to be a healthy \\npractice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today\\'s \\nscience, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is \\nhighly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet \\nthe stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There \\nisn\\'t any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of \\ngovernment money on the scientific establishment.  \\n\\nTwo centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies \\nto which every other nation in the world has been subject at one \\ntime or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and \\nreligion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has \\ntried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of \\nabortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street \\n-- has wound up being shed.  \\n\\nReal human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people\\'s \\nlives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of \\nlivelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate, \\nto diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels \\nfor electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates, \\nwhen they die from the effects of obesity.  \\n\\nWhat we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two \\nmore centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of \\nstate and science -- including medicine.

Just to try to get the same people\\nevery year, provide a basic training to new people so they can\\nbe integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it \\nrequires a continually standing committee of organizers.  \\n\\nSince a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and\\ndisipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claim\\na \"well regulated militia\" is not well organized.  But I will concide \\na \"well organized militia\" is not necessarily a \"well regulated militia.\" \\n\\nSeveral people have stated that the \"well organized militia\" is\\nwhat is defined under 10 USC 311, which states\\n\\n\\tThe militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied \\n\\tmales at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in \\n\\tsection 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, \\n\\tor who have made a declaration of intention to become, \\n\\tcitizens of the United States and of female citizents of \\n\\tthe United States who are commissioned officers of the \\n\\tNational Guard.\\n\\nThis deos define the militia, but were is the adjective \"well regulated.\"\\n10 USC 311 does not define a \"well regualed militia\" in any way, shape, \\nor form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia\\nThe Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the \"well regualed militia\" as a\\nproper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above, it\\ntalk above \"disciplining all the militia of the United States\" so they\\nfit the \"character of a well-regulated militia.\"  This is what the\\nparagraph states about the associated costs:\\n\\n\\tIt would form an annual deduction from the productive labor \\n\\tof the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the \\n\\tpresent numbers of the people, would not fall far short \\n\\tof the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all \\n\\tthe States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the \\n\\tmass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,\\n\\twould be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not \\n\\tsucceed, because it would not long be endured.\\n\\n\\nAnother quote provide by Charles Scripter is:\\nJames Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the \"General Welfare\" clause): \\n\\t\"Nothing is more natural nor common than first\\n\\tto use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a\\n\\trecital of particulars.\"\\n\\nSo the phrase \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall \\nnot be infringed\" must either qualify or explain the phrase \"a well \\nregulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.\"  \\nThe definition of \"explain\" as stated in \"The American Hertitage\\nDictionary of the Enlish Language\" The New College Edition, 1982 is:\\n\\t1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from;\\n\\t   elucidate: \"It was the economists who undertook to explain \\n\\t   this puzzle\"\\n\\t2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan.\\n\\t3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for\\' justify:\\n\\t   explain an error\\nThe second phrase clearly does not \"explain\" the first, therefore\\nthe second phrase must \"qualify\" the first.  The definition given\\nfor \"qualify\" is:\\n\\t1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities\\n\\t   of; characterize.\\n\\t2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or \\n\\t   task.\\n\\t3) To give legal power to; make legally capable.\\n\\t4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions.\\n\\t5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate\\n\\t6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase)\\nSince \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be\\ninfringed\" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything and\\nit has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task.\\nBy process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since\\n#3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, it\\nmust be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore, \"the right \\nof the people to keep and bear Arms\" gives legal power to the \"well \\nregualated militia\" and this legal power \"shall not be infringed\".  \\n\\nI thank you very much Mr Scripter, you have provided me with more \\nevidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the \\npeople\\'s right to form well regulate militia, and says very little \\nabout the right of an untrained person to \"keep and bear\" a .50 caliber\\nmachine gun.  And since I, totally untrained in the use of any firearm\\n(something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gun\\nsafety course and joining a gun club), cannot legally buy such a machine\\ngun, I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with\\nme.\\n\\n-> So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy\\n-> our Liberties and Rights.\\n\\nI mean \"to destory our Liberties and Rights.\"  Is that why a participate\\nin the discussion of exactly what \"our Libertues and Rights\" are?

It\\nhas been whether they fired their main guns.

There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place\\nwithout it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American\\nmilitary firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have\\nbeen *big* news.\\n\\nAwesley goes on:\\n  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.\\n\\nTo fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion\\ngrenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.

On February 4th, the Wall Street Journal\\ncarried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled \"Armed Force.\"  I\\nfelt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat\\nthat \"A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect.\"  I sent\\nthe following to the WSJ.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nGun Stats & Mortal Risks\\n\\nPreston K. Covey\\n\\n\\n\\tErik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~\\n2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns\\nin the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King\\nCounty, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more\\nlikely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to\\nkill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it\\nhas grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated\\nby one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of\\nthe finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine\\n(NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping\\nfirearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~ \\n \\n\\tResponsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of\\nbringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this: \\nWhat exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither\\nthe whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the\\nrisks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control\\ndo we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of\\ncancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the\\nrisks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful\\nhere. \\n\\n\\tThe NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us\\noff.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a\\nmisleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice\\nand terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far\\noutweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your\\ncar were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or\\nan innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not\\ntake the bus?  \\n\\n\\tUncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company\\nof lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at\\nstake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:\\n\\n\\tThe ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the\\nnumber of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense\\n(the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed\\nby a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation\\nis 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other\\ncases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12\\naccidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided\\nby 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King\\nCounty between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of\\nhomes unaccounted.\\n\\n\\tThe NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on\\nsix counts:\\n\\n\\t1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or\\nacquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and\\nneighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is\\nthat the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members,\\ndear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic,\\nbut the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are\\nrelevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the\\ncalculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless\\nWaltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is\\ncriminological hogwash.\\n\\n\\t2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs\\npopulated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories\\n-- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited\\nby more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities\\nlike drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is\\nvery low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but\\navoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with\\nhistories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and\\ncertifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious\\nrisk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as\\nignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither\\ngun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or\\nvehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver\\ncrucially affect the risk. \\n\\n\\t3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is\\nthat the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill\\nthan to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of\\npersonal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike\\nLarson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43\\ntimes as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun\\nViolence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this\\nparticular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about\\nwhether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by\\ntautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question\\nbegged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any\\ncase, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal\\ninstruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths\\nare personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility\\nobviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by\\ngun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to\\nNEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself. \\nPeople have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their\\nhomes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection\\ncourse do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and\\nsober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death\\nas do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard\\nand obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they\\ndisregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and\\nother risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we\\nresent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose\\nnorms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign\\nus to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in\\nthe matter.\\n\\n\\t4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the\\nNEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County,\\nincluding those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total\\ndeath toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other\\nstudies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from\\nhomicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these\\nsuicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true\\nthat attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously\\ntrue that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these\\nsuicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of\\nresearch on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is\\nwishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce\\nL. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press,\\n1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of\\nPsychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of\\nthe NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to\\n~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the\\ncauses, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a\\nprofoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally\\ndisregard this issue.\\n\\n\\t5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable\\nrate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the\\nNEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases. \\nBut many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled\\nself-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case\\ndispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of\\njustifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story\\non women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women\\nwho appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17,\\n1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic\\ncases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were\\nreported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported\\nthat 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In\\nTime~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error\\nby a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged\\nby promulgators of the NEJM statistic. \\n\\n\\t6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation\\nare arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The\\ndivisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not\\naggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even\\nshot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the\\ncoin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy\\nis it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure\\nthe utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as\\nopposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or\\ndeterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where\\nno human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed\\nto media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the\\ncompendious research on successful armed defense, notably by\\ncriminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America ,\\nAldine de Gruyter, 1992)?\\n\\tKleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are\\nbased on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is\\nhigh (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare\\nbetter than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance\\nor those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year\\nby 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and\\naccidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable\\nstatistic than the NEJM scare stat:  \\n\\nA gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or\\nother crime than to kill anybody.   \\n\\n\\tOf course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation;\\nwhat is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We\\nshould indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation\\nof defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic. \\nClearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by\\nuncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we\\ncan hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we\\nhardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically.\\n\\n-- \\nLarry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com\\n',\n",

That helps\\n  people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,\\n  \"bullshit filters\".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.\\n  \\nLater in the same post:\\n     Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building\\n  were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and\\n  am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.\\n\\nFine, *now* you are stating that you believe their claims (or that you are\\n\"inclined\" to.  See below for a stronger statement of your beliefs).  Those\\nclaims are still ludicrous, however.\\n\\nPreviously Awesley had written:\\n  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.\\n\\nPrompting me to write:\\n  To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion\\n  grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be\\n  perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn\\'t you, since\\n  it makes your other claim seem more plausible.\\n\\nTo which Awesley replied:\\n  John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you\\'re losing it so you\\n  have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said\\n  nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you\\n  need some help, let me know and I\\'l take your side of this for a\\n  while.  You\\'re not scoring here, you\\'re boring here.\\n\\nBut why did you mention grenade launchers at all?  Because it supports the\\nnotion that the tanks shelled buildings.  And it supports that notion\\nbecause it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades.  But\\nthat too is ludicrous.\\n\\n  If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been\\n  screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about\\n  it. \\n\\nAwesley relied:\\n     Glad to know you\\'re such an expert.  Nice to hear some an\\n  authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it\\n  had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an\\n  authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged\\n  massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.\\n  Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but\\n  the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \"several\".  I\\'ve also\\n  heard some things about that but I won\\'t dare repeat them.  You\\'d\\n  assert that I claimed they were truth.\\n\\nYes, if it happened I would have heard about it.  Everybody would have. \\nArmy tanks don\\'t fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960\\'s\\nwithout it becoming common knowledge, without minority leaders seizing on\\nit and condemning it over and over again, without civil libertarians saying\\n\"this has gone far enough.\"  So, yes, my never hearing of it was the basis\\nfor my disbelieving the claim.  Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it. \\nNot one poster has written to say, yes, I lived in Detroit at that time and\\neverybody knew that the tanks had fired shells.  This is the UseNet.  If it\\nhad happened, somebody here would remember it.  Furthermore, your own\\nresearch failed to come up with any support for the claim.  The claim is\\nextraordinary and it has no supporting evidence, extraordinary or not. \\nUnless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit.  I\\ndo not.\\n\\n  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. \\n\\n     Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the \\n  difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 \\n  years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.\\n  So it would have been an Army cover-up.\\n\\nQuibble.  Fine, it was an Army cover-up.  Six years in the Reserves has\\ntaught me the difference also.  But do you think that in two and half\\ndecades not one guilt-ridden participant has come forward and said \"yes, I\\nshelled Americans,\" or \"I gave the orders to fire the cannons,\" or \"I\\nhelped cover it up\"?\\n\\n  If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I\\nprefer\\n  to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that\\n  those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.\\n\\nAwesley replied:\\n    Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I\\'m quite willing to believe\\n  that they did fire their guns.\\n\\nGood.  Then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they did. \\nYour belief fails a basic reality check: why isn\\'t it known?\\n\\nAwesley concludes:\\n     Now then, we\\'ve bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read\\n  this far and all you\\'ve managed to say is that you don\\'t believe the\\n  account I cited.\\n\\nActually, now we have established that I don\\'t believe what you believe, as\\nwell as why I don\\'t believe it.  And if it\\'s boring, then I yield the last\\nword to you, if you want it.  You may say anything you like with\\nimpunity--I am dropping the subject.\\n\\n--John L. Scott\\n',\n",

PEXlib is a slightly\\n\"lower\" level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX\\nextension to X.\\n\\nSome advantages of using PEXlib...\\n- Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS\\n- Provides immediate mode capabilities\\n- Is free of \"policy\"\\n- PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support\\n  features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).\\n  PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.\\n\\nSome advantages of using PHIGS...\\n- Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones\\n- Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output\\n- PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier\\n- PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you\\n- PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.\\n\\nIf you\\'re working strictly in X and don\\'t care about things like\\narchiving, I would go with PEXlib.

Here\\'s a very simele question to which\\nI\\'m sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please\\nanswer yes or no, Roger:\\n Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?\\nAL only, please.\\n\\nFor anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact\\nthat a team\\'s win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the\\nteam scores and the number the team allows. It\\'s not a definite,\\nhard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a\\nrule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,\\nfor every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.\\nSo, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that\\nthey scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other\\nthings being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack\\nMorris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238\\nfor Boston), the \"Red Jays\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or\\nenough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn\\'t take into account that Viola\\npitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in\\n(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you\\nreally do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs\\nhis team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this\\nanalysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would\\nnecessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but\\nthat is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and\\nevaluate Viola\\'s as better than Morris\\' in the sense that \"had Morris\\nperformed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.\"\\n\\n\\nThis is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.\\n\\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com\\n\\nComputer...if you don\\'t open that exit hatch this moment I shall zap straight\\noff to your major data banks and reprogram you with a very large ax.

Neither of them wanted to work a full four hour show, so Ed\\nColeman and Dave Sims' old four-hour slot was broken down into two\\nseperate two-hour show - Lupica from 10-12, and Berman from 12-2. And they\\nboth happen to suck in comparison to Eddie and Dave.  COME BACK, GUYS!\\n\\n\\nLike I said, I live in Philly, so I can hear FAN and/or WIP whenever I\\nwant. But I cannot stand WIP. And it isn't because I loathe the Philly\\nsports teams - the Phillies are my favorite NL team (Yanks are favorite\\nAL), and the Eagles aren't too bad either. There are two big problems:\\n\\n\\t1)Total emphasis on the home teams, especially the Eagles. Unlike\\n\\t  the FAN hosts, who can at least answer a question about an\\n\\t  out-of-town team if a caller asks, the WIP hosts seem\\n \\t  to have no clue about any team that doesn't play on\\n\\t  Broad Street. Also, FANs periodic sports updates (every 20\\n\\t  minutes) gives sports news and scores from around the\\n\\t  country. It's very rare to hear an out-of-town score\\n\\t  being reported on WIP.\\n\\n\\t2)The hosts. With the exception of Jody MacDonald, who I miss\\n\\t  from his days at FAN, none of the hosts really seems to have\\n\\t  both a broad knowledge of the sport or a good on-air presence.\\n\\t  The worst is Gary Cobb, who seems to have been hired solely\\n\\t  on the basis that he used to play for the Eagles.\\n\\nAnyway, that's my two cents on the whole FAN vs WIP battle.\\n\\n-Alan\\n\",\n",

This was\\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It\\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I\\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\\n  purpose packages I\\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\\'m not sure how general purpose\\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\\'ve\\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\\'s a\\n  freebie if you want it\"\\n\\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\\n  Excel on the Mac if it\\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldn\\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use\\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\\'s mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which I\\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,\\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\\n\\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\\n===================================================\\n\\nGRASS\\n-----\\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\\n  capabilities.\\n\\n  Feature Descriptions\\n\\n  I use GRASS  because it\\'s public domain and can be obtained through the\\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  CERL\\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\\n\\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\\n  Parks\\' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\\n  it and mail him comments/corrections.

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\\n\\n  Feature Description\\n\\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\\n\\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\\n  for GIS applications.\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\\n\\nPCI\\n---\\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\\n\\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\\n  God only knows what all else -- there\\'s a LOT.  I don\\'t have and don\\'t\\n  use these, so can\\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your\\n  particular application/interest calls for.\\n\\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\\'s\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphic-arts industry\\'s \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven\\'t tried)\\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\\n  YOU\\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  It\\'s worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\\n\\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\\'s\\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\\n  areas.\\n\\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\\n--------------------------------\\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\\n\\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\\n\\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\\'re interested.  PCW requires X\\n  for display.\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\\n\\nCLRview\\n-------\\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\\n\\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.

       " 'This was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list.\\n=============================================================\\nHi Folks;\\n\\nThursday, April 15 marked Day 3 of the trial.\\n\\nThis day marked the first testimony of the trial.  Deputy\\nU.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution.\\n\\nThe short version is that his testimony was consistent with\\nthe opening statements for the prosecution.\\n\\nCooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington)\\non August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation\\nwith five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was\\nusing night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up\\ninto two teams of three people.  The six later met at an\\nobservation point above the cabin.  After this, deputies\\nCooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent to\\nscout further possible surveillance sites.\\n\\nCooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into\\na gully to see, \"whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond.\"\\nStriker, the Weaver\\'s yellow lab, started toward them barking\\nloudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area.\\n\\nThey ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the\\n\"fern field\"] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, Kevin\\nHarris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance\\nteam had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should\\ntake cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy\\ntarget and might be \"shot in the back.\"\\n\\nAs Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the\\nroad from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire.\\n\\nAt this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to \"fend\\nhim off with his gun.\"  [It is unclear whether this means he\\nclubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then\\ntook cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris and\\nSamuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not\\nnoticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degan\\ngot up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, \"Stop!  U.S.\\nMarshal!\"  Harris then \"...brought the weapon around at hip level\\nand fired.  He didn\\'t bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw\\nBill\\'s arm going back, and I knew he had been hit.\"  Cooper fired\\nat Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon\\nto bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper then\\nheard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the\\ndirection of the shots, yelled, \"You son of a bitch!\" and ran\\ntoward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him\\nfrom directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the\\ncabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward\\nthe cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first two\\nfingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and\\nthen his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and the\\nother three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large\\nburst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.\\n\\nOn cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point of\\nthrowing rocks into the gulley, asking, \"You wanted to lure that\\ndog out so you could shoot that dog, didn\\'t you?\"  Nevin also\\npointed out that in last September\\'s testimony, Cooper had\\nclaimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him.\\nCooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and\\ndecided that Thursday\\'s account was correct.  Nevin continued the\\ncross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an\\narmed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at\\nhim [no answer was available].\\n\\nFriday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper.\\n\\nNotes: There was no coverage of protestors.\\n\\nDrew\\n==============================================================\\n\\n-- \\n**************************************************************\\n* Ron Phillips               crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com *\\n* Senior Customer Engineer                                   *\\n* Intergraph Electronics                                     *\\n* 381 East Evelyn Avenue               VOICE: (415) 691-6473 *\\n* Mountain View, CA 94041              FAX:   (415) 691-0350 *\\n**************************************************************\\n',\n",

       " '\\n       Two questions:  When was this, and do you have the relevant\\nnumbers.  (Please note, this is *not* in any way an indication I don\\'t\\nbelieve you or that you\\'re not correct, but when the drop occured is\\nrelevant.)\\n   \\n\\n       The primary objection (beyond ones based on the ideal of\\nRKBA that it is simply not something the government should do) is\\nthat it makes guns a play-thing and tool of the rich and connected.\\nIt discriminates against the poor.\\n\\n       Is self-defense considered appropriate, and if so, under what\\nconditions?  (Are you allowed, for instance to get a gun for protection\\nif you\\'re going to be carrying a very large sum of money on a regular\\nbasis or have been threatened.)\\n\\n\\n       This has been suggested in the U.S., and generally supported among\\ngun owners.  What many object to is that many, if not most, proposals\\ncontain a sort of \"gotcha\" clause which allows an arbitrary denial, even\\nif you qualify in every way.\\n\\n\\n       At this point, it should be pointed out that in general\\na driver\\'s licence in the U.S. is for the most part nothing like its\\nEuropean counterpart.  I understand getting one is far more difficult\\nthere than here.  In the U.S. it\\'s a joke. \\n\\n       But my usual objection is that you\\'re discussing two different\\nthings.  For instance, in the U.S. a driver\\'s license is a permit\\nto operate a motor vehicle on a public road.  It is not necessary\\nto own one, or to operate it on private property.  That is, the\\nability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise\\nfrom the government\\'s legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations\\nfor behavior on public lands.  A permit to own an automobile, for instance,\\nwhich is far closer an analogy, would be a much harder thing to get\\npast legally, since it wouldn\\'t be based on making regulations on public\\nproperty, but in restricting activity on private property.              \\n\\n\\n        This varies *widely*.  (One thing I think Europeans have\\na difficult time with is that the U.S. has fifty unique jurisdictions,\\nwhere the laws from one state to another can be as radically different\\nas from one country in Europe to another).\\n\\n        Some places allow open carry of both guns and knives.  Some allow\\nconcealed.  Some prohibit both, or allow one or the other.  And it can\\nbe either a state or local restriciton.       \\n\\n\\n       The question must be asked:  Is the right of *this* individual\\naffecting the rights of this *other* individual.  What we usually\\nget is that the rights of this *group* (meaning some individuals within\\nthis group, here defined as \"people who own guns,\") are adversely affecting \\nthe rights of some other group.  \\n\\n       If for instance, \"Bob\" were using his gun to attack \"Steve,\" you\\'d\\nhave a point.  But essentially what we\\'re discussing is that becuase\\nsome person who qualifies as a member of the group \"people who own\\nguns\" then some third person, perhaps in another *time zone* is told\\nthat their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else\\'s\\nrights.  It\\'s like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited\\nby one.\\n\\n\\n       The issue is crime, violence, and murder.  The question is to\\nwhat extent guns and gun legislation impact those.\\n\\n\\n       Of course not.  It would be nice if we didn\\'t have to fear that\\nother people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us.\\nBut currently we don\\'t have that option.  Nor do I expect we will.\\n\\n\\n       No state does.  In any case, there\\'s a limit to which the state\\nmay enforce it\\'s \"wisdom\" on me.  Freedom in general is an unwise\\nconcept.  If you pre-emptively restrict everything which might be\\n\"unwise\" then freedom becomes a meaningless concept.\\n   \\n\\n       I\\'ll raise my hand against driver\\'s licenses.  As currently\\nimplemented they\\'re a waste of time and little more than revanue\\ngeneration for the State and ignored by a startling number of\\ndrivers.  It does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than is\\nnecessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody\\nelse killed, or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten year\\nold will have picked up riding around in his parents car.\\n\\n       But, as I mentioned, they\\'re two different things.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDavid Veal Univ. of Tenn.

       " \"Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some\\nhelp with it.  We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in\\naddition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray\\nlevel images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to\\nformat the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial\\nproblems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a\\nparallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4\\nbit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the\\n256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video\\nsignal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they\\ndid say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but\\nthey didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they\\nwould call Japan, etc.\\n\\nFrankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images\\nfrom the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not\\nlike memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on\\ngetting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would\\ngreatly appreciate your sending it to me.\\n\\nThanks.\\n\\nAllan Weber\\nSignal & Image Processing Institute\\nUniversity of Southern California\\nweber@sipi.usc.edu\\n\",\n",

       " 'Off and on over the last several months, threads about RBIs and\\nrelated topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can \\npredict a player\\'s RBIs using information about his overall\\nperformance and the number of runners in scoring position (RISP)\\nthat he bats with.  In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated\\npredicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This \\ncompletely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2 \\ncould do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I\\'d\\ntake that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to\\nthe data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.\\n\\nI\\'ve started with team data, using data from the Elias\\'s that\\nI\\'ve picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and\\nb) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias\\'s profits.\\nThat gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don\\'t \\nhave team RBIs for \\'87 or I could add that year.)  If you\\nrun a simple least squares fit to the data you get \\n\\n(RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.\\n\\nThe correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is\\nsignificant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the\\nfit is good at the team level.  I\\'ve no started to move on to \\nthe player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark,\\nOzzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to \\nadd quite a few more during my copious free time this year.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the\\nlow HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it\\ncould just be Ozzie.

However, expressing\\n    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well\\n    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far\\n    exceed their technical skills.\\n\\n    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression\\n    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and\\n    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the\\n    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of\\n    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar\\n    representions, a confounded user asks: \"What does it all mean?\"\\n\\n    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and\\n    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by\\n    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media\\n    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic\\n    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for\\n    composing imagery for understanding.\\n\\n    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a\\n    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the\\n    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,\\n    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and\\n    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the\\n    computer graphics context.\\n\\n\\n    FEATURED SPEAKERS INCLUDE:\\n\\n        Psychology/Perception:\\n            Marc De May, University of Ghent\\n            Beverly J.

       " 'First, I would like to say how much I appreciate having so literate and\\nerudite an individual as Mr. Rutledge with whom to discuss this topic.\\nFrankly, most anti-RKBA posters refuse even to approach the topic of\\nthe original understanding of the Bill of Rights as detailed in the\\nwritings of the era. This  is most refreshing.\\n\\nSecond, I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days.\\nMy brigade\\'s quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attend\\nto several matters pertaining to the State Militia.\\n\\nSome people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro-\\nnism that is out of place in the 20th century. I\\'m not sure the Swiss\\nwould agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia, both\\norganized and unorganized, fits into the defense plans of my State,\\nMississippi. Please do not assume that this describes something peculiar\\nto one southern state. For instance, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\\nhas a well organized Militia which, members report, maintains stocks\\nof both riot guns and machine guns. The laws of other States will vary\\nbut are probably similar.\\n\\nTitle 35  of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as \"all able-bodied\\ncitizens of the state between the ages of seventeen (17) and sixty-\\ntwo (62) years...\". The Militia is divided into 3 classes: The National\\nGuard, the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia.  The\\nNational Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective.\\nIt tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve. The discussion\\nof this \"para-constitutional\" arrangement is quite interesting in itself\\nbut somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. Suffice it that, at this\\ndate, the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standing\\nas anything but a Federal reserve force.\\n\\nMississippi, and most other States, maintains a purely State organized\\nMilitia. In Mississippi this is called The State Guard. In other \\nStates it may be called something else. The State Guard exists as\\na cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers and\\nsenior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation. We drill\\non a monthly basis at the company and battalion level, brigade once\\na quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization. Our\\nState-authorized cadre strength is 694. This is a skeleton of an\\norganization without any flesh. The muscle and sinew when needed will\\ncome from the unorganized Militia.\\n\\nIn time of invasion, insurrection or calamity the Governor can order\\nthe activation of the State Guard. When this takes place a call will\\nfirst be made  for volunteers to fill the organization out to either\\nits contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910. In the\\nevent that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer, the law\\nprovides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of the\\nunorganized Militia. The size of the State Guard is not specified by\\nlaw, but rather by executive order. At one time, the organized Militia\\nof Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments. Needless to say, the State\\ndoes not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip such\\na force. The historical precedent for arming such a force is by use\\nof mostly the private arms of the Militiamen. \\n\\nIt is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from being\\nthe long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim.\\n\\n\\nRegarding Hamilton: If you take Hamilton\\'s opinion as being the sole\\nrepresentative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers, you will have\\nchosen a highly skewed sample set. Hamilton was on the extreme Federalist\\nend of the political spectrum. Others, such as Coxe and Henry, can\\nbe chosen to represent the other end. Many contemporaries felt that\\nthe idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militia\\nor \"train bands\" were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern-\\nment they were striving to perfect. The compromise reached was to\\nprovide for a small Army, which had to be refinanced every two years,\\nand iron-clad protection for the Militia, which was to remain ever,\\n\"terrible and irresistible\".\\n\\nThese protections included: State control, not Federal; limitation\\nof Federal utilization of the Militia (i.e. execute Laws, suppress\\nInsurrections and repel Invasions), and the Right to Keep and Bear\\nArms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington.\\nThese limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern-\\nment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard.\\n\\nThe National Guard was created for one very simple reason: the \\nConstitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fighting\\nwars of imperial expansion. (e.g. Spanish-American War). The\\nConstitution provided that the Militia could only be employed by\\nthe Federal government in very limited purposes. As far back as the\\nWar of 1812, Militia units had refused to leave United States\\nterritory to attack the enemy. Further, there was no Constitutional\\nauthorization for any conscription of anyone into the Federal\\nMilitary and Militiamen were particularly protected. In all wars until\\nWW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer.\\nWhen the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each new\\nmember also enlist as a reservest in the Army, existing soldiers were\\n\"grandfathered\". At least one of these \"grandfathered\" individuals\\nrefused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by the\\nFederal Courts.\\n\\nMr. Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only to\\nmembers of a \"well organized\" militia. However, the pre-Constitutional\\nhistory of the American Militia shows relatively few periods when\\nThe Militia came close to meeting either Messrs. Rutledge or Hamilton\\'s\\ndefinition of \"well organized\". In the period of peace between the\\nFrench & Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stopped\\ndrilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution.\\nPerhaps Mr. Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestors\\nwho answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights because\\ntheir units didn\\'t drill for a few years in the 1760s. I would not\\nbe so bold.\\n\\nAgain, I wish to repeat. The National Guard, for all its merits, is\\nnot the Militia described by the Constitution  nor by Mr. Hamilton\\nnor by Mr. Henry nor by Mr. Coxe. The fact that the Federal Government\\nand many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizing\\nof their Constitutional Militias  diminishes neither their\\nresponsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in the\\nConstitution.\\n \\nMisunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but one\\nerror that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution. The\\nConstitution prohibits States from keeping \"Troops or Ships of War\\nin time of Peace\". I have heard some insist this prevents States from\\nmaintaining a Militia, but this comes about because people today do not\\nunderstand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage.\\nToday we call any large vessel a \"ship\" but in the 18th century the word\\ndescribed a particular kind of vessel.  A \"ship\" is a large vessel with\\nthree or more masts each carrying square rigged sails. A \"brig\" has two\\nmasts. In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keeping\\nthe largest warships of the day, those capable of global operations. Today\\'s\\nequivalent might be a prohibition on the States\\' keeping nuclear missiles.\\n\"Troops\" at this time meant a full-time professional military organization.\\nAny study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out. \\n\\nIn at least one respect, I am in agreement with Mr. Rutledge; being\\npersonally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militia\\nas a viable means of defense for a modern society, I am frequently\\nboth bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic on\\ntheir place in the unorganized Militia and become strangely silent or\\nscarce when invited to attend a  drill of their State\\'s Militia.\\n-- \\nDonald R.

       " '\\nHaving read the posted long article by JPFO, I have some observations:\\n\\n1.  This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a \"verbatim \\ntranslation\" of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place --\\nthe book they\\'re talking about -- they compare the two things section\\nby section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating.\\nIn the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce \\nthe German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation.  Not \\nsurprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a \\nsingle idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi\\nlaw; and sure enough, that\\'s what the whole thing has mutated into, \\nurban-folklore style.\\n\\n2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a \\ncopy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution \\nteam or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don\\'t \\nunderstand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable \\nto imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and \\nyet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly:\\n\\n\"If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons\\nLaw during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of\\ndocuments, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German\\nlaw registry].\"\\n\\nBingo.  Exactly.  \\n\\nDodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one\\nunder discussion.  All of the stuff about \"Why would a U.S. congressman\\nhave a copy of a Nazi law?\" melts away, by the author\\'s admission.  He\\nthen continues:  \"But if he acquired the original German text of the \\nNazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so \\nfor a very specific reason...\"  But there\\'s absolutely no reason to \\nthink that this is the case.  In fact, as a \"senior member of the U.S. \\nteam that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals\", it seems to me that\\nhe would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether \\nthe Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously\\nis, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personally\\nprosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red \\nherrings.\\n\\n3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, the\\nJPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he \\nasked to have it translated.  The problem is, in the context of the charge \\nlevelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  People ask \\nto have things translated when they *don\\'t know what they mean*.  If Dodd \\ntook it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing \\nit into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*, \\nwouldn\\'t he?\\n    Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier\\nposting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this\\npurpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent\\non disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil\\nliberties, needed a crib sheet?  Didn\\'t they have any idea how to do it\\non their own?\\n    Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his\\nown question: \"Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law\\nto show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the \\nNazi law.\"  In fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered\\ninto the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents \"concerning\\nthe history of Nazism and gun confiscation\", Dodd\\'s motivation isn\\'t a \\nmystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR.\\n\\n4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that\\nwas added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law.  \\nRegistration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOT\\na \"Nazi-inspired\" idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the \\n1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification \\nof certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list \\nother parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews;\\nof course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless,\\nin a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the \\ndiscussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues, \\n\"Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA\\'68...\" -- so \\nas to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law.\\n-- \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t-- Don Porges\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tporges@inmet.camb.inmet.com\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t..uunet!inmet!porges\\n',\n",

       " 'Was going over some videos last night.....\\n\\nStudying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very\\ninteresting.  And enlightening.\\n\\nHere\\'s my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep \\'92, and Jose Canseco,\\ncirca June 1986.\\n\\n1.  He\\'s bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,\\n    not gain more bulk.\\n\\n2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I\\'d say he\\'s\\n    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that\\'s a HUGE amount of speed.\\n\\n3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like\\n    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is\\n    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -\\n    Canseco can\\'t.  Also, note that Canseco doesn\\'t always close his\\n    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,\\n    they\\'re fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it\\'s hard\\n    to make adjustments in your swing.\\n\\nWhat would I do, if I were Jose?\\n\\nAside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,\\nso that I\\'d never have to work again, I\\'d restructure my entire swing.\\n\\nFirst, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,\\nand severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this\\nwill cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move\\nthe bathead more freely.\\n\\nSecond, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.\\n\\nThird, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find\\nmy 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling\\nthe wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength\\n is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of\\nthe park.\\n\\nIf Canseco\\'s open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back\\nproblems, he\\'ll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could\\nstill hit 600+ HR.\\n\\n\\n-- \\n*   Gary Huckabay   * \"You think that\\'s loud enough, a$$hole?\"           *\\n*   \"Movie Rights   * \"Well, if you\\'re having trouble hearing it, sir,   *\\n*   available thru  *  I\\'d be happy to turn it up for you.

       " \"Here is a press release from the White House.\\n\\n President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A\\n To: National Desk\\n Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100\\n\\n   WASHINGTON, April 20 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Following are\\nremarks by President Clinton in a question and answer session\\nwith the press (Part 2 of 2):\\n\\n     Go ahead, Sarah.\\n\\n     Q  There are two questions I want to ask you.  The\\nfirst is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not\\nhave gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance\\nbecause this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was\\nvery dangerous to the children and they could not have survived\\nwithout gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't\\nthose people have a right to practice their religion?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their\\nreligion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had\\nviolated federal laws, any number of them.\\n\\n     Q  What federal laws --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't\\nanswer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the\\nwhole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they\\nwere convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but\\nit would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of\\nthe things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of\\nthis because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were\\nspeculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that\\nthe windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have\\nescaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.\\n\\n     They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground\\ncompound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be\\nsent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if\\nthe children were not released immediately outside that the humane\\nthing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace\\nwhere they could be protected.\\n\\n     In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned\\nyesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas\\nwas supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks\\nthemselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they\\nall had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a\\nnonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.\\n\\n     MS. MYERS:  Last question.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --\\n\\n     Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked\\nJanet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you\\nlearned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your\\nmind during those horrendous moments?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had\\nconsidered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said --\\nand, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the\\npublic -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that\\nthe people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues\\nconcluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would\\nbe tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in\\nthe future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were\\nright or wrong, of course, we will never know.\\n\\n     What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the\\nbuilding burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate\\nconcern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were\\nescaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.\\nThat's the first thing I wanted to know.\\n\\n     Thank you.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a\\nJanet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't\\nhave a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't\\ngo over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I\\ntake responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I\\nsigned off on the general decision and giving her the authority to\\nmake the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had\\nelapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said,\\nif you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you.\\nAnd I do support her.\\n\\n     She is not ultimately responsible to the American\\npeople; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an\\nappropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as\\nwell as she could have.\\n\\n     Thank you.  (Applause.)\\n\\n -30-\\n\",\n",

Digital immortality.\\n\\nThe basic idea behind \"digital immortality\" is that computer networks   \\nare here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them\\nwill be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the\\nartifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they\\'ll be put in different\\nformats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they\\'ll be\\nthere...and someone will dig them up.  \\n \\nIf that doesn\\'t interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique\\nand exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes\\nand exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang\\nas wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is \\nbreathed into your work...and by merit of it\\'s stimulus, it will \\ntravel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.\\n \\nSpectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and \\nlet the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own\\ncopies of the images to look at when you\\'ve got the gumption...\\nthat\\'s what they\\'re here for.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWHERE?             \\n\\nOTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.  \\n \\n \\t141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tsunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite \\n\\t(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)\\n\\nMerely \"anonymous FTP\" to either site on Internet and change to the\\nappropriate directory.  Don\\'t forget to get busy and use the \"bin\"\\ncommand to make sure you\\'re in binary.\\n\\nOTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North\\nAmerica....the following systems have a substancial supply of\\nOTIStuff...\\n\\tUnderground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines\\n\\tCyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n \\nHOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?\\n              \\nWhat happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   \\nphoto, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put\\nit in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me\\n(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,\\nit will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works\\nare also welcome.\\n\\nOTIS\\' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  \\nGIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to \\nsee.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at \\nmost large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit\\ntougher to find.  If you can\\'t find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  \\nyou can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    \\nJPG files to a standard GIF format. \\n\\nOTIS also accepts animation files.      \\n\\nWhen you submit image files, please send me email at the same time\\nstating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be\\nused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people\\nto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we\\'ll\\nbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You \\ncan also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of \\nemailing).\\n\\nIf you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send\\ncopies to:\\n\\nThe OTIS Project\\nc/o Ed Stastny\\nPO BX 241113\\nOmaha, NE 68124-1113\\n\\nI will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  \\nscan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  \\nAlso include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line \\ndescription of the image that we can include in the infofile in the\\ndirectory where it\\'s finally put.  If you have preferences as to what\\nthe images are to be named, include those as well.  \\n \\nConversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please\\ncontact me and we\\'ll arrange things.\\n\\nIf you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\"\\ndisk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.\\nThis is good for people who don\\'t have direct access to encoders or FTP,\\nbut do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM\\ncompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or\\nJPG.  If you can\\'t...we can convert from most formats...we\\'d just rather\\nnot have to.\\n\\nAt senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they\\ncan stand.  Even if you don\\'t have stuff to contribute, you can send\\na blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to \\nget a slab-o-OTIS.\\n\\nAs of 04/21/93, we\\'re at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  \\nEmail me for current archive size and directory.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISTRIBUTION?\\n\\nThe images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   \\non the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is\\nnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to\\nanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local \\nbulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the\\nappropriate text files along with the images.  \\n \\nIt would also be nice if you\\'d send me a note when you did post images\\nfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so\\nparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.\\n\\nIt\\'s the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as\\npossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite\\nBBS system....or even just post this \"info-file\" there.  It would be\\nkeen of you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUSE?\\n\\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\\nyou\\'ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \\nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the \".rm\" file for    \\nthe image or series of images...or in the \"Artists\" directory under the \\nArtists name.  If permission isn\\'t explicitly given, then you\\'ll have \\nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I\\'ll get in contact with the artist for \\nyou, or give you their contact information.\\n \\nWhen you DO use permitted work, it\\'s always courteous to let the artist\\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\\ncompensation for their files.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNAMING IMAGES?\\n\\nPlease keep the names of your files in \"dos\" format.  That means, keep\\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\\nfour digit \"code\" for the series of images, plus the series number.\\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci\\'s fifth mechanical drawing would be something\\nlike:\\n \\n\\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\\n\\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\\nremain intact on all systems.  \\n\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \\n\\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\\n\\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\\nsomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in\\ncase they\\'d like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,\\naddress or other information you\\'d like people to know.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHMMM?!\\n\\nThat\\'s about it for now.  More \"guidelines\" will be added as needed.\\nYour input is expected.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS  \\n \\t     (a sumerian deity) or it\\'s followers, be they pope, priest,\\n\\t     or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations\\n\\t     however.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original \\n \\t     image files.  The files will go to the public at large.  \\n\\t     It\\'s possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone\\n\\t     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.  \\n    \\t     Unless you\\'ve given permission for that, it\\'s illegal.  OTIS\\n\\t     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights\\n\\t     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to \\n\\t     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed \\n\\t     electronically.  If you don\\'t want your images distributed     \\n\\t     all-over, don\\'t upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is\\n\\t     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or\\n\\t     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not \\n\\t     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,        \\n\\t     screen-printed clothing, etc).

       " '\\nRather, people kill people with guns.  The sad truth is: sometimes that is\\ngood, or at least, better than the alternative.\\n\\n\\nOk.  There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1], and the\\nnumber has been in decline since early this century [2].  Most of these\\naccidents involve rifles or shot guns, not handguns.\\n\\n...\\n\\nIn fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that. \\nThe idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber\\nhandgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense,\\nwould, I\\'m sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  It certainly isn\\'t\\nwhy I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it,\\nand might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to\\nkill people.\\n\\n\\nIn fact, that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive uses\\nof firearms don\\'t involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefer\\nnot to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what\\nyou say when you point a gun at them.\\n\\nIf you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to\\nimmediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  A handgun is\\nabout the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work\\nthe best.[3]\\n\\n\\nCertainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing)\\naren\\'t deadly weapons.  However, it simply isn\\'t true to say that all of\\nthem were designed to kill people.  Moreover, what exactly is wrong with\\nhaving deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to\\nuse deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right,\\nbut my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and\\nknowing how to use the tools to do that.\\n\\n\"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear\\narms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in\\ngovernment.\"\\n\\t- T. Jefferson.\\n\\nI think what Jefferson said is still true.\\n\\n\\nNot very often compared to other use.[3]\\n\\n\\nThis isn\\'t that common either, at least when compared to other uses.  It is\\nvery rare that a non-violent person will suddenly \"get-pissed\" and kill\\nsomeone, gun or not.  In most cases, the people who murder have long\\nhistories of violence.  If you have good reason to believe that these\\npeople wouldn\\'t kill if they didn\\'t have a gun, feel free to present it.\\n\\n\\nRight, but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope I\\nnever have to shoot a person, but I\\'ve had to kill a number of animals from\\nrodents to cows, and when I do, I don\\'t want them to suffer any more than\\nis necessary.  I prefer they die instantly, but failing that, I want them\\nto drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that,\\nI don\\'t want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon and\\nammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I\\'m\\nafter, but it doesn\\'t always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point,\\npeople who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns,\\nparticularly handguns, haven\\'t used them much for that purpose.\\n\\n\\n[1] Accidental deaths in 1988:\\n\\t48700 deaths by auto\\n\\t11300 deaths by fall\\n\\t 5300 deaths by drowning\\n\\t 4800 deaths by fire\\n\\t 4400 deaths by poison\\n\\t 3200 deaths by food\\n\\t 1400 deaths by firearm\\n\\n     Source: Statistics Department, National Safety Council.\\n     \"Accidents Facts 1988 Edition\".

It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only\\nat that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the\\nwhole design should be changed to support 24bit images.\\nThat were not done and now we have\\n -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)\\n -the program has human interface errors.\\n\\nOtherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without\\nclearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.\\n\\n[ ..deleted.. ]\\n\\n==clip==\\n\\nSome new items follows.\\n\\n==clip==\\n\\nI have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24\\noption than with default option we have.\\nThe reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise)\\nthe same than used in ppmquant.\\n\\nIf you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I found\\nthat rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv\\n(our default) in that order. In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly\\n-- it actually gave image with bad artifacts.\\n\\nI don't know is ppmquant improved any, but I expect no.\\nSo, use of XV's -best24 option is not very good idea.\\n\\nI suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used in\\nrlequant -- I'm sure rle-people gives permission.\\n(Another could be one used in ImageMagick; I have not tested it, so I\\ncan say nothing about it.)\\n\\n==clip==\\n\\n==clip==\\n\\nSome minor bugs in human interface are:\\n\\nKey pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; Often it happens\\nthat I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong\\nplace. It is very annoying when you have waited image to come about\\nfive minutes and then it is gone away immediately.\\nThe buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.\\n\\nAlso, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard\\nand mouse for XV after the image is completed.\\nOften it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just when\\nI'm writing something with editor or such. Those key pressings\\nthen go to XV and image has gone or something weird.\\n\\nIn the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XV\\nupdates the images. It is impossible to change all RGB values first\\nand then get the updated image. It is annoying wait image to be\\nupdated when the setting are not ready yet.\\nI suggest of adding an 'apply' button to update the exchanges done.\\n\\n==clip==\\n\",\n",

       " 'Kevin Mitchell\\'s sacrifice fly in the eighth off Brett Saberhagen plated \\npitch runner Cesar Hernandez to give the Reds a 2-3 come-from-behind victory over \\nNew York. Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started \\nwith a solid single to right, moved to second on \"Bob\" Kelly\\'s infield sneaker\\ndown the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson\\'s well-placed bunt--a \\nrare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.\\n\\nCincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only \\ngiven up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double\\nby Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after\\nJoe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who \\nargued plate umpire Kellogg\\'s inside strike by \"drawing the line\" (really, he\\nshould know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting\\ntossed.\\n\\nThe Mets\\' fifth started with a Howard Johnson\\'s first-pitch homer.  Pugh must \\nhave been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent\\'s\\nsingle, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell\\nand turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley\\'s grounder to the drawn-in Branson\\nfailed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:\\n\\nSaberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield\\nto discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly:\\nThompson was hung out to dry after Pugh\\'s first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended.\\n(Isn\\'t the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)\\n\\nThe Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin\\'s\\nground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back\\nsingles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long\\nfly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but\\nthird base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was\\nhung out to dry killing the Reds rally.\\n\\nRob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner\\non second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game\\nin late August last year when Bonilla\\'s three-run dinger slapped a loss on\\nDibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci\\'s season.  Bonilla ended\\nup walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a \\nweek, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win went\\nto Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings\\nwork, striking out three.

If so, just how \\'open\\' does it\\nhave to be?  Would an in the pants holster be considered concealing?  What\\nif one had their jacket on and it partially covered the weapon?  Also,\\nis there any way to be allowed to carry concealed, or is it just not allowed,\\nperiod? \\n\\nQuestion #2\\n\\nAs I understand it, in Evanston, IL, they have a ordinance banning handguns.\\nIs there any way to get around this provision?  What would the penalty if\\nyou were found out be?  What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting\\nin your apartment there?  How would the city law apply to your impending \\ntrial for the shooting?\\nAlso, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreled\\nshotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available, \\neither that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt, Marlin).  \\nOne more thing, what is the chance of getting a CCW permit in IL without being\\nrich or famous or related to the mayor?\\n\\nPlease send replies via E-Mail, as things seem to be piling up around t.p.g\\na little faster than I can handle.

       " '\\n\\tOh, yeah.  Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn\\'t hit a lick, had\\nnegligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield,\\nnow entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent\\nhitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime,\\nhe had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don\\'t \\nknow where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are\\nsimilar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn\\'t field,\\nhe ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his\\nOBP wasn\\'t THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important)\\nwas a absolute-primo-dick.  \\n\\tEddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80\\'s.  I know that\\nMVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the\\nMVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn\\'t overrated by the media.  \\n\\tLee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one\\'s actually pretty close.  He\\'s had a s\\nsolid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks \\n(Wrigley, Fenway...).  I\\'d have to take a closer look at the stats (it\\'s been \\na while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  \\n\\tYou do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,\\nsimply racking up a lot of saves doesn\\'t mean a whole hell of a lot if you \\nblow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)\\nAtlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, \\nthe Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should \\nHomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.\\n\\tDarrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like\\nTed Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF\\'er.\\n\\n\\n\\tLemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN\\'T marginal?\\n\\n\\n\\tNow, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the\\nposition of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he\\'s won something along\\nthe lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a \\ngood argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie\\'s more\\nrecent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early\\n80\\'s getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie\\'s\\noffense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his\\ncareer, depressed offense, admittedly, no power (\\'cept against Tom Niedenfuer\\n:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.\\n\\tYount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real\\nstiff.  His \\'82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,\\nand probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as\\nSS numbers go.  He\\'s a clear HOF\\'er, IMHO.\\n\\n\\n\\tWell, as far as Garvey goes, you\\'re right.  Garvey is a \"mediot\" \\ncandidate, pushed because of his \"winning attitude\" (a minor factor, if one\\nat all), and his \"great defense\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of\\na tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn\\'t be in the HOF.\\n\\tSkyJack?  I\\'ve said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last\\nyear or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk\\nabout Morris\\' \"ability to win\" which is nothing more than Morris\\' \"ability\\nto pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\".  At this point, Morris is an\\naverage pitcher (although from his early returns in \\'93, he may be damned \\nclose to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the\\n80\\'s for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year\\nfor Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but\\nnot favorites.  Morris\\' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF\\n\"consideration\".  \\n\\tRyan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will\\nthrow back your earlier logic about \"Yount and Smith being shortstops who \\nhung around a long time\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he\\'s \\njust pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre...\\n(Of course, Nolan\\'s a HOF\\'er...)\\n\\tPuck?  Probably, although he\\'s got to play reasonably well for a few\\nmore years (10 years, even good ones, aren\\'t enough to make the HOF, most\\nlikely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much\\nregardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY \\ntragic or sudden).  He\\'s very popular in the media and with fans, and\\nlegitimately has been one of the best CF\\'s in the game since he joined the\\nleague.  I\\'ve always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the\\nend, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it\\'s too early to sell.\\n\\n\\tThis debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it \\nor not, I never tire of it.  It\\'s an interesting subject.  Here\\'s an off\\nthe top of my head list of potential HOF\\'ers from each team.  I probably\\nleft a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.

The Police Chief suspended Cranston pending an \\ninvestigation into the use of excessive force.  \\n\\tThe above is pretty clear... but what seems to have \\nhappened is this.  The Chief requested Cranston's gun, but Cranston\\nrefused to turn it over until the Chief went the Cranston's home\\n to get it.

THIS VERSION\\nNOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for\\nC programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free \\nto contact me.\\nThe other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from\\nthe FPU version to make it run faster.\\n\\nThose of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.\\n\\n********\\n\\nProgrammers 3D GrafSys -- What it is:\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nDidn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of \\ndrawing three-dimensional scenes? \\n\\nDidn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure \\nof three-dimensional molecules?\\n\\nAnd didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from \\nactually doing it?\\n\\nWell if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to \\ndo with this package???' , read on.\\n\\nGrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines \\nfor building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating \\n(independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling) \\nthree dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.\\n\\nGrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-\\nline/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.\\n\\nGrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel\\nprojections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing\\noff for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain\\nwhat it all means later on). \\n\\nGrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with\\ndata so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines\\nto do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so\\nyou don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)\\n\\nGrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above \\nprocessors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.\\nBoth versions are *100% source compatibel*. \\n\\nGrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D\\ngraphics and how to use the package.\\n\\nIf demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. \\nHowever, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for\\na lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.\\n\\nGrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage.

Feel free to contact the local branch manager...we\\nunderstand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers, so give it a\\nshot.\\n\\n\\nAs one of the previous posts stated, the Personal IRIS was introduced in\\n1988 and grew to include the 4D/20, 4D/25, 4D/30 and 4D/35 as clock rates\\nsped up over time. As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5\\nyears. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series ('85-'89), the PI\\n('88-'93), the Professional Series (the early 4D's - '86-'90), the Power\\nSeries parallel systems ('88-'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a\\nparticular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphics\\narchitectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every\\n18 months to 2 years.\\n\\nThese are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they become\\nalmost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new\\nplatform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths,\\nfaster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities. If we\\ndon't, we become uncompetitive.\\n\\nFrom the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your\\ncurrent needs and makes economic sense today.  You can't wait to buy, but\\nif you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Rep\\nfor one in writing. If it's feasible, they should be able to do that. Some\\nof our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as\\nthe Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series\\nmultiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain\\na guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge\\nR4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.\\n\\n\\nIf that's happening, it's becausing of misunderstandings or\\nmis-communication, not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy our\\ncustomer base.\\n\\n\\nMost SGI customers are onesy-twosey types, but regardless, we rarely give a\\ngreat deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because\\nagain, like a previous post stated, if we pre-announced and the schedule\\nslipped, we would mess up our potential customers schedules (when they were\\ncounting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date) and\\nwould also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial\\nanalysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our\\ncommitments.\\n\\n\\nFive years is an awfully long time in computer years. New processor\\ntechnologies are arriving every 1-2 years, making a 5 year old computer at\\nleast 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times. The competitive nature\\nof the market is demanding that rate of development, so if your timing is\\nreally 5 years between purchases, you have to accept the limited viability\\nof whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor.\\n\\nThere are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live\\nwith, but keeping customers happy is the most important, so don't give up,\\nwe know it.\\n\\nJosh   |:-)\\n\\n-- \\n\\n\\n**************************************************************************\\n**\\t\\t\\t\\t     **\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t**\\n**\\tJoshua Mogal\\t\\t     **\\tProduct Manager\\t\\t\\t**\\n**\\tAdvanced Graphics Division   **\\t  Advanced Graphics Systems\\t**\\n**\\tSilicon Graphics Inc.\\t     **\\tMarket Manager\\t\\t\\t**\\n**\\t2011 North Shoreline Blvd.   **\\t  Virtual Reality\\t\\t**\\n**\\tMountain View, CA 94039-7311 **\\t  Interactive Entertainment\\t**\\n**\\tM/S 9L-580\\t\\t     **\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t**\\n**\\t\\t\\t\\t     *************************************\\n**\\tTel:\\t(415) 390-1460\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t**\\n**\\tFax:\\t(415) 964-8671\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t**\\n**\\tE-mail:\\tmogal@sgi.com\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t**\\n**\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t**\\n**************************************************************************\\n\",\n",

On the\\n<-> contrary, to anyone who understands the game, they have strengthened it.\\n<\\n<No, I originally argued that the Second Amendment was \"a little bit\\n<and an anachronism.\"  These prohibiting laws are examples why the are\\n<an anachronism.  After all, laws in made by representatives of the \\n<people.  These representatives of the people have already decided\\n<that the Second Amendment does not apply or is too broad in some\\n<cases.  Since these representatives feel an unconditional \\n<interpretation is not wanted, then it is probable that they majority\\n<of the people feel the same way.  If this is so, it is an example\\n<of the people using their power of government.  If this is not\\n<how the people feel, the people should stand up and state their wishes.\\n\\nWrong.  Neglecting that the government and media have bullshitted the\\npeople almost nonstop on this issue, Constitutional limitations are\\nthere to prevent a \\'tyrrany of the majority\\'.  For example, a majority\\ncould vote that given ethnics have no rights, are not people, etc.\\nand it would fly using the logic above.\\n\\nWhen government feels the Constitution is not right for the times,\\nthere is a procedure called an AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.  THis\\nis deliberately difficult, and cumbersome, to prevent abuse of those\\nwho decide to ignore the people, or impose unjust policies of a\\nmajority on a minority.   A lynch mob is a majority, remember, outvoting\\nthe hangee.\\n\\nWhat the government is doing are VIOLATIONS, end-runs around the\\nlimitations on the government, probably because they know that the\\npeople would be very hard to convince that a good intention is behind\\ntampering with the Bill of Rights.  Government propeganda on guns has\\nbeen very strong and persistant, but not THAT strong.  And it just\\nshows how gullible the people have become to \"I am from the government\\nand am here to help you sort of line\".  We have been lied to, fed\\nhalf truths, rigged stats, while the government knows their control\\nlaws have no effect on crime.  They want a government monopoly on\\nforce, pure and simple.

There are not all that many people who have both the skill\\n   AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.\\n   High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such, but\\n   the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun\\n   - and would pay through the nose for it.\\n\\nGood point you make.  However, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude,\\nhomemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accurate\\nfire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recall\\nthe tiny, single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for\\nuse by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable of\\neffective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means of\\nkilling German soldiers for their guns.\\n\\nAlso note that the crowd-pleasin\\' favorite, the Sten gun, was\\nspecifically designed to require as little machine work as possible.\\nThe point\\'s been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steel\\ntubing, hand tools and a welder.\\n\\nI still think that while the point is good, I think there\\'s a difference\\nbetween marijuana and firearms, in that quality marijuana can be grown\\nlocally; there\\'s no need to import the stuff.  If guns are banned, I\\nthink the demand for \"real\" guns will be sufficient to make smuggling\\neconomically feasible, thus rendering a ban moot.  In any case, the\\nresult would be the same--people who aren\\'t criminals won\\'t have\\nfirearms, and \"bad guys\" will continue to have access to them, one way\\nor another.

But some neutrons would \\nalso hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives\\nwould remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear\\nwarhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.\\n\\nAs for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince\\nis required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in\\na dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private\\nownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must\\nbe able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe\\ncondition. If any random private citizen could not properly\\nkeep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation\\nis clearly appropriate.\\n\\n\\n\\nI disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend\\nthemselves and their community. If you look at the American \\nrevolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves\\nfrom, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They\\ndidn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for \\nexample) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same\\nold regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and\\ndestroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate.\\nBut their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited\\nfor that.\\n\\nThere is also the question of personal and collective arms: The\\nSecond Amendment definately protects ownership of personal\\nweapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members\\nto provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers\\nother arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example)\\na tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively)\\nshould. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a \\ndisproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower.\\nThe militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely\\ndemocratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only\\n50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would\\nbe proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular\\nwill were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the\\nmembers supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the\\nform of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's\\nfirepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not\\nof the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite\\ndifferent from the general public (at the very least, they\\nwould be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and\\ncharacter of the militia requires that each member provide\\na roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personal\\nweapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.\\n\\n                                                  Frank Crary\\n                                                  CU Boulder\\n\\n\",\n",

Apparently NRA members, and other\\n  \"gun-nuts\" are purchasing firearms at in record numbers, pulling the\\n  economy out of the recession.  \"Their buying them five times faster than\\n  ever before, and stockpiling left and right\", the Vice President said.  \\n\\n  However, since many domestic firearm and ammunition manufacturers have\\n  been experiencing hard times during the past few years, including several\\n  declarations of bankruptcy by many leading American gun makers, they have\\n  not rushed to increase hiring to meet the new demand.\\n\\n  \"We want to see if this run will continue before hiring more people\", said\\n  the President of Colt industries.  \"As long as Clinton is in office, we\\n  suspect it will\", he added.\\n\\n  In response to this new information, President Clinton announced a new\\n  Gun Control measure to be introduced into Congress this session.  It\\'s \\n  called the \"Ban-One-A-Month\" Gun Control Bill.  Under the terms of this law,\\n  every make and model of all firearms will be written on individual index \\n  cards.  The cards will all be put in a big hat and the President will draw\\n  one card every month.  Sixty days later that gun will be banned from any\\n  further manufacture/importation or sale in this country, except to the\\n  politically connected and to members of the National Police Force.\\n\\n  The President said, \"This law will benefit America two ways.  When the\\n  Gun-Of-The-Month is announced every thirty days, the gun-nuts will run\\n  out and buy thousands of them, boosting the economy even more.  In addition,\\n  over the long run, we will get all of these icky-evil guns off of the\\n  street.\"  He also announce the appointment of Sarah Brady to oversee\\n  this program, citing her \"Honesty, and unbiased view on the subject\\n  of gun control\".\\n\\n  Senators Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Feinstein, and Boxer have proposed an\\n  amendment to the Bill which would add additional index cards containing\\n  caliber designations for all know ammunitions.  \"Their stockpiling,\\n  stockpiling, stockpiling\" screamed Metzenbaum during a press conference\\n  at the national Headquarters of Handgun Control Inc.\\n\\n  Senators Simon, Metzenbaum, and Moyenhan also introduced an amendment\\n  that would make all guns illegal to possess once the last card has been\\n  drawn from the hat.  Senator Simon was quoted as saying, \"First we\\'ll\\n  fuck em, then we\\'ll kick em out of bed in the morning\", during a press\\n  conference he held in the second floor Mens Restroom of the Senate\\n  building.  He of course was referring to the fact that he would allow\\n  the people to purchase the guns to help the economy, but would require\\n  the BATF to seize all of the guns in America sometime in the year 2008,\\n  after all of the cards have been drawn.\\n\\n  The head of the BATF responded by saying, \"We will have to see if this\\n  thing in Waco is over by then.  We may be too busy to seize all those\\n  guns\".\\n\\n  US House Representatives Pat Schroeder and David Skaggs of Colorado\\n  declared this proposed law as being \"reasonable gun control which won\\'t\\n  affect anybodys Constitutional right to own sporting guns\".\\n\\n  - end article -\\n\\n  For the humor impaired :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-) \\n\\n                                Bill Vojak\\n                                vojak@icebucket.stortek.com\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNRA, ILA,\\n                                Colorado Firearms Coalition\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nThe CBS Nightly Propaganda With Dan Rather.
